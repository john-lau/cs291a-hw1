FT941-10619	ft 09 feb 94 doubts persist on bosnia air strikes growing pressure for action in the republic	the massacre of 68 shoppers in a sarajevo market last weekend has concentrated world attention as never before on the need for effective action in bosnia even those like britain who have always had deep reservations about the usefulness of military intervention are talking about more muscular action and even that paragon of caution mr douglas hurd uk foreign secretary has said that the sarajevo atrocity brings us near a decision in one way or another to use force yet for all the huffing and puffing and the widespread feeling that enough is enough a big question mark hangs over the use of air power the only type of military action any of the western powers is prepared to contemplate the statement issued by the european union s foreign ministers at their meeting in brussels on monday that nato and the united nations should try to lift the siege of sarajevo using all means necessary including the use of air power certainly marks a political change of direction only last spring the europeans rejected a us proposal which included the use of air strikes against bosnian serb artillery positions as well as the selective lifting of the arms embargo against the bosnian moslems in practice however a decision to go ahead with air strikes now lies in the hands of nato which has been asked by mr boutros boutros ghali un secretary general to authorise such bombing raids if these are considered feasible and once the responsibility for the sarajevo massacre is deemed to have been clearly established the advice of senior nato and un commanders will be crucial in any final decision to launch air strikes and it is no secret that most military experts are extremely sceptical about their effectiveness in bosnia s wooded and mountainous terrain after a two hour meeting of president bill clinton s senior national security advisers on monday mr william perry defence secretary indicated that he and general john shalikashvili chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had expressed their doubts about such a course of action we take very seriously the limitations of air strikes against first of all artillery type targets and secondly any targets that are embedded in a civilian population bosnian serb artillery and tank positions when they are not concealed in forest are reported to be highly mobile and easily relocated when under attack if they were deployed in populated areas air strikes would risk killing innocent civilians moreover serb and moslem positions are frequently so close to each other that bombing raids could kill combatants from both sides quite apart from the military limitations of air strikes recognised by mr warren christopher us secretary of state when he said a whole range of other options were also being considered there are many political and ultimately humanitarian drawbacks the launching of air strikes against the bosnian serbs by triggering retaliation against inadequate un forces could bring to an end the whole un peacekeeping operation in bosnia and greatly jeopardise if not halt altogether the delivery of international aid equally serious air strikes while satisfying the growing desire of western public opinion and governments for punitive action are unlikely to bring a political solution any nearer that is why britain as well as the us continue to insist that they be linked to clear objectives that would end the conflict both france and britain have been doing their utmost so far with little success to persuade the us to become more closely involved in the peace negotiations the us which was responsible for sinking the original vance owen plan for the division of bosnia hercegovina into 10 semi autonomous provinces has been equally unenthusiastic about the international mediators subsequent project this would carve the country up into three ethnic mini states serb moslem and croat but has proved unacceptable to the moslems who argue that the territory allocated to them does not amount to a viable country washington has all along refused to support a solution which is not approved by the moslems thus making sure that the stalemate at the geneva peace conference which has been further exacerbated by croat moslem fighting and territorial disputes will not be broken one possible way out of that stalemate is agreement by the three warring parties to the mediators proposal that as a first step a separate agreement should be reached on sarajevo which would demilitarise the city and place it under un administration such a partial solution which would cover an area of some 1 500 sq km around sarajevo would relieve the siege of the city by putting it out of range of serb guns lord owen the eu s representative has indicated that mr radovan karadzic the bosnian serb leader would be willing to negotiate such an agreement though the latter is notorious for failing to keep his word a rapid separate agreement on sarajevo on which talks are due to be held in geneva tomorrow could be the best way of avoiding a military escalation in bosnia with unforeseeable consequences it could also be the first step towards an overall peace settlement which remains the only way to end the conflict

FT941-10648	ft 08 feb 94 markets report little dollar movement	yesterday was a day of consolidation in foreign exchange markets following friday s excitement when a tightening of monetary policy by the us federal reserve caused a sharp rise in the dollar writes philip gawith expectations of further dollar gains against the d mark were not realised and the us currency ended trading in london at levels similar to those reached in after hours activity on friday evening against the yen it weakened slightly from late friday levels as one observer noted with all of the market looking in one direction expecting the dollar to rise not much happened the market was uncertain about the pace and extent of future rate movements in the us mr alan greenspan fed chairman has a reputation as a gradualist and thus most observers expect further small increases with the federal funds rate ending the year at 3 75 per cent or 4 per cent explaining the dollar s fairly sedate performance after some profit taking during asian trading mr jeremy hawkins senior economic adviser at bank of america commented the trend has changed but the gradient of change looks like it is still going to be very shallow so it is positive for the dollar but not positive enough to give the dollar much of a kick so long as german rates remain unchanged the us currency ended in london at dm1 7630 the level at which it was trading late on friday evening but higher than the close of dm1 736 it finished against the yen at y108 7050 after trading in a narrow range all day in new york last night it closed at dm1 7586 and y108 60 the d mark was under pressure yesterday finishing lower against most other european currencies attention today will be focused on the repo announcement from the bundesbank if the central bank allows a variable rate tender following a period of fixed rate tenders at 6 per cent this will be taken as a signal that it is happy to sanction a softening of interest rates given the chance the market would certainly try to drive rates lower but any fall in the repo rate will be small as the repo rate at 6 per cent is only 25 basis points above the discount rate which acts as a floor for official german rates however the symbolic message that rates were on their way down would be a powerful one although the weak state of the german economy favours a cut in rates the bundesbank might not want to ease policy against the background of a weak currency mr mark austin treasury strategist at midland global markets comments there is a belief now in the market that the bundesbank has got itself into a bit of a hole it had various opportunities to cut rates which it passed up and now it is going to be more difficult mr austin said it was not clear that keeping rates high now would help the currency the recent history of the erm suggests high rates have been ineffective in supporting a currency perceived by the market as weak most analysts argue that the market is more interested in measures aimed at stimulating growth few however are confident that the bundesbank shares this view indeed mr norbert walter deutsche bank chief economist said in washington yesterday that the bundesbank might hold off lowering interest rates at least until regional elections in mid march and could even raise rates temporarily if the d mark were to weaken too much i would not fully exclude the possibility that the bundesbank will increase short term rates said mr walter yesterday bundesbank president mr hans tietmeyer speaking in his capacity as the g10 central bank governors chairman said g10 central bankers were not troubled by developments on foreign exchange markets following the us fed s tightening of policy on friday until now there is not much concern about the situation on forex markets mr tietmeyer told reporters after the monthly meeting of g10 central bank governors in basle the belgian franc closed at bfr20 62 to the d mark down three centimes over the day after the belgian central bank trimmed interest rates the belgian national bank cut its key central rate by 15 basis points to 6 70 per cent the central rate is now at its lowest since july 2 when it was set at 6 70 per cent the central bank later had to raise interest rates because of the erm currency crisis in late july belgium s central rate was last reduced a week ago observers said yesterday s move was further evidence of ems currencies decoupling interest rate policy from the bundesbank when conditions allowed sterling had a fairly quiet day trading around the dm2 61 level

FT941-10651	ft 08 feb 94 commodities and agriculture minerals sector needs to woo foreign capital most of the existing mining industry is in a pitiful state	opening the school of mines in st petersburg in 1719 peter the great proclaimed our russian state in comparison with many other foreign countries is blessed with all necessary metals and minerals this perception of russia as a treasure house of minerals persisted until recently it was encouraged both by a communist regime that saw self sufficiency in raw materials as an important element in the nation s capacity for self determination and by conservative hawks in the west who used the notion to dramatise the dangers of soviet infiltration in other mineral rich parts of the world notably southern africa since the opening up of russia to the west the existence of substantial economic deposits of oil and gas has been confirmed for metals however the evidence is far less clear moreover some of the resources that do exist are in remote eastern regions that lack the infrastructure to permit the establishment of viable mining activities what is clear is that most of the existing mining industry is in a pitiful state grades at copper lead and zinc mines are well below those in the west the mineral from which aluminium is produced is of a quality that would not be used elsewhere and the alluvial gold deposits of the far eastern region long the mainstay of soviet production are largely worked out nickel alone appears to be mined from a deposit of genuine world class that at norilsk in the far north throughout the industry under investment has left operations with inadequate equipment very low productivity and primitive environment protection practices these problems are being added to daily by increases in energy and transport costs and by a breakdown in the payments system in consequence between 1989 and 1993 the country s production of copper fell by about 22 per cent of zinc by 27 per cent and of nickel by 48 per cent one option available to russia is to focus its reconstruction efforts on downstream manufacturing activities but this would be unwise for three reasons first bad as the condition of of the mining industry is the sad fact is that this is one of the healthier industrial sectors second metals are important export items second only to oil and gas and for the foreseeable future russia will have precious little else to sell and finally attempts to compete in manufacturing will pitch russia into direct competition with the low wage economies of the far east and the more strategically located countries of europe to develop russia s mining industry will require capital and capital is one thing russia does not have one answer is to turn to foreign investors but although in their public statements the russian authorities appear favourable to foreign investment in practice they are more ambivalent there remains a deep rooted suspicion of the motives of foreigners and a fear of under selling the country s mineral wealth to the extent that a role is seen for foreign companies it is frequently in the development of deposits of too low a grade of too complex for local companies the successes of the nationalists in the december parliamentary elections can only reinforce these tendencies no country is obliged to accept foreign investors on its soil but if russia really is interested in involving foreign capital in major mining development there are issues that it needs to address greater openness is needed before all else western companies have to be convinced that there is something worth investing in at present however they are only able to visit selected sites by invitation or work from lists containing limited detail clarification is required on how jurisdiction over mineral resources is to be divided between the centre and the regions while moscow was preoccupied with the battle between president yeltsin and the parliament many regions took the opportunity to assert sovereignty over resources within their borders the new constitution appears to reverse this tendency but the need for clarification remains finally greater realism needs to be displayed in the legal and fiscal conditions for foreign investment western mining companies will need to be able to assure their shareholders that they will see a return on their money much russian legislation on resources has been framed with oil and gas in mind and is inappropriate for hard minerals for instance the typical demand for a 20 per cent royalty on revenue from gold mining in addition to a 35 per cent tax on profits could easily translate into and effective tax rate of over 100 per cent of profits russia has been edging towards a new role in a competitive world economy in this economy countries wanting inward investment have to compete for it just as companies have to compete for good investment opportunities unfortunately years of isolation have left russia without an adequate basis for international comparison and have permitted the perpetuation of myths about its mineral wealth russia is not a special case it may have extensive mineral deposits but these are of little value without the capital to get them out in the world that russia is joining capital does not come without capitalists david humphreys is deputy chief economist at the rtz corporation his monograph mining and metals in the cis between autarky and integration is published today by the royal institute of international affairs

liffe ended at 116 17 32 down 3 4 point on friday s close but little changed on the day although the uk is generally seen as lagging the us economic cycle by six months it is ahead of the rest of

the yield curve much more dangerous said mr john kendall an economist at baring brothers the market showed little reaction to the release of stronger consumer credit data for december which underlined the fact that economic recovery is gaining ground a modest upturn in the level of pay settlements according to the latest survey by incomes data services the information and research organisation also

FT941-10738	ft 08 feb 94 jitters below a calm surface the potential impact of the banesto affair on other spanish banks	a vast red banner bearing the figure eight and a percentage sign covers one side of banco santander s office tower in the madrid financial district it advertises the latest shot in the mortgage wars among spanish banks over the past year the largest trading screen in spain says one banker gesturing at the banner from his office window the intense competition for retail banking business is one problem facing players in what has been one of the world s most stable and profitable banking markets a second potentially larger problem emerged a month ago when the bank of spain dismissed the old management of banco espanol de credito banesto the central bank has now put together a rescue plan to cover a pta605bn pounds 2 9bn hole in banesto s balance sheet the plight of banesto has raised questions about other banks particularly those such as banco central hispano which like banesto holds substantial equity stakes in industrial companies until there is a full explanation of what happened at banesto it is logical to ask which other bank will be next says mr robin monro davies managing director of ibca the london based bank ratings agency banesto s problems emerged when bank of spain inspectors discovered its dollars 61bn of assets had been over valued the provisions made by the bank against loan losses were insufficient and its equity holdings were not worth as much as it claimed this was despite regular inspections by the bank of spain and monitoring by banesto s adviser the us bank j p morgan some observers however argue that banesto was a special case it was run by mr mario conde a colourful industrialist whose methods were distrusted by other banks it expanded its loan book very fast between 1988 and 1991 it was heavily exposed to spain s recession and it cut margins between its deposits and loans as it fought to increase its market share banesto was an exceptional bank and its problems should not have a big knock on effect on others says mr julian hollis an analyst at s g warburg the london based investment bank others point to steady profits reported by other banks for 1993 the high quality spanish banks achieved quite a creditable performance last year says ms sheila garrard of securities house lehman brothers not surprisingly directors of other spanish banks agree that the sector is in a good state santander last week reported a 17 8 per cent rise in after tax profits to pta77 9bn mr juan inciarte chief executive says the fact that banks have maintained profits in the midst of recession indicates their strength the basic profitability of spanish banks is without question he says the strength of spanish banks has enabled them to survive the first shocks created by banesto s problems but in spite of the optimism of many observers the longer term impact could still be damaging the plan to clean up and re capitalise banesto see accompanying article could affect other banks in three ways first they will have to increase contributions to the deposit guarantee fund the state run scheme which uses contributions from the country s banks to insure deposits to compensate for the pta285bn the fund will spend on acquiring banesto assets the drag the fund has on banks earnings had been easing since the last banking crisis now it will grow the second effect is that banks have been asked by the bank of spain to contribute to a pta180bn rights issue buying shares which eventually they will try to sell the banks could gain from this investment but if banesto s difficulties are not solved by the latest recapitalisation it may have to be rescued again through a takeover each of the large banks faces the risk of being prodded into saving banesto by the central bank the third effect is less direct one reason why estimates of banesto s difficulties have varied markedly is that it is impossible to determine an exact market value of any bank s smaller loans and assets banks gradually adjust the value of their assets over economic cycles by making and sometimes reducing provisions against bad debt because banesto s assets were so suddenly devalued some observers believe other banks may be galvanised into taking a more conservative view of their own loans when one bank is declared sick then others start to re examine their assets and some are liquidated says mr carlos martinez de campos barclays bank s director of european retail banking the effects would have to be very large to weaken the other private banks significantly through their large branch networks spanish banks have gathered cheap deposits from unsophisticated rural customers they use these funds to make personal and small business loans at relatively high interest rates until santander broke an informal cartel in 1989 by offering interest bearing deposit accounts this ensured one of the highest net interest margins the profit margin on lending and deposit taking of any banking market the banks were also forced by the bank of spain to maintain high capital ratios and make conservative provisions against loan losses the combination led to high returns on strong capital but the banesto incident comes at an awkward time for spanish banks the sector has been suffering the consequences of one of the country s deepest post war recessions this has pushed the ratio of problem loans to its highest point since the banking crisis of the late 1970s during which 50 banks had to be bought and refloated by spain s deposit guarantee fund there are other uncertainties facing spanish banks competition has increased both for loans and for deposits santander s latest mortgage campaign follows similar deposit wars this has eroded the net interest margin of the top spanish banks from 4 6 per cent in 1988 to 3 2 per cent in 1992 the fact that the margin in france and germany is below 2 per cent indicates the potential for a continuing squeeze mr hollis of s g warburg says that banks face pressure on margins as customers shop around more the banks may in turn grow better at protecting their margins by using financial derivatives such as options but it is likely to be a losing battle the thing you can guarantee is that margins will erode as customers get more sophisticated says mr hollis the bank of spain s effectiveness as a supervisor has been put under scrutiny for the first time since the 1970s banking crisis when it was widely perceived to have been lax and ineffective in monitoring banks since then it has generally been assumed to be so rigorous that investors could trust spanish banks assessments of their asset value following the 1970s banking crisis the central bank has built up a team of 160 inspectors spain has not signed accords drawn up by the basle based committee of international bank supervisors because it prefers its own rules international standards are not high enough they are too imprecise says one official this iconoclastic approach will come under greater scrutiny from investors the pressure on bank s revenues is not confined to their traditional lending and deposit business trading income is also under pressure banks maintained their earnings last year because they were able to gain revenue from other sources for instance by increasing earnings from foreign exchange and capital markets operations reductions in short term interest rates also increased the value of their bond portfolios but such earnings will not recur this year mr jose garay director of the chemical bank in spain says that banks gained enormously from the four percentage point fall in short term interest rates in 1993 this year they will be forced to depend on traditional banking operations i think this is going to be a very hard year for some banks he says banks in other countries have responded to such pressures by cutting costs through reductions in branches and staff but the potential for cuts is limited although spanish banks have large branch networks they typically employ relatively few staff in each branch furthermore strict labour laws make it difficult for banks to dismiss staff compulsorily these factors have made spanish banks look forward to the end of recession with eagerness investors confidence in the sector has survived the banesto upset but it could be sapped by a further squeeze on revenues and the value of assets for the moment banks have avoided being tarred with the same brush as banesto their grace period may not be indefinite

training the unemployed stimulating in company training and fostering economic development tecs are unable to tap certain funds if they do not meet the precise terms and conditions of the contract the budget issue could be addressed over the next few months tecs are set to go into battle with the government over funding and some say they could sustain budget cuts if they had more flexibility confusion about the tecs mission and role several government departments work with tecs and there have been confused and conflicting messages over priorities the government has said tecs should pay more attention to their enterprise role but such activities only command a small part of their funding the government may be going some way to addressing this problem from april two institutional changes could have a significant impact on tecs and their role in local economic regeneration first 10 integrated regional offices iros are to be created combining the local departments of environment transport employment and trade and industry the intention is to bring coherence to government programmes at regional level second as part of this change 20 existing programmes for regeneration and economic development will have their funding pooled within the so called single regeneration budget to be administered locally by the 10 iros according to mr david hunt employment secretary and the tecs main paymaster the old patchwork quilt of initiatives will become as it were a seamless duvet at the local level for the first time bodies that traditionally bid for regeneration funds such as local authorities will be obliged to involve the private sector in other words the tecs mr hunt said last week we need to see effective local partnerships coming forward to take full advantage of the potential these new developments have for local regeneration these partnerships will only succeed in winning funding for their initiatives if the private sector is fully involved how effective the changes will be in co ordinating local economic plans remains a moot point but big opportunities are being offered to those tecs most able to define their contribution for instance how many young people they can retrain to work on a construction project demonstrable progress will be slow however for while the government trumpets that the total amount of the single regeneration budget in 1994 95 will be pounds 1 4bn only pounds 100m has not yet been allocated mr hunt announced a second big shift by the government which last week gave the green light to tecs which want to merge with chambers of commerce mergers between the two organisations was one of the main recommendations of prof bennett s report not only could they result in fewer turf wars over the provision of services they would also provide tecs with broader access to the business community counties such as kent could point the third way forward at a time when local government reorganisation is prompting a rethink of many council services the tec can provide stability at a time of change said sir alastair morton together we can develop quite a formidable development agency but are such changes enough to strengthen local economic planning mr amin rajan an employment consultant who recently completed a study of tecs said the government probably thinks it has done enough to create a climate in which better partnerships can be made but there are still question marks over whether that will be sufficient there is a lot of ground to be covered before all the local players reach agreement on who does what the proposed kent merger and the fact that tecs may start to merge with chambers of commerce indicates a willingness for public and private sector to work more closely together but the relationships will take time to formulate and the integration of local economic planning could be frustrated unless the inflexible conditions attached to tecs funding are loosened and they acquire more freedom to act where and how they see fit

from brussels to national regional or local authorities mr major did not quite take up the latter point in the tory mind subsidiarity stops at whitehall to the two opposition parties if devolution is

lost between president bill clinton s gung ho young entourage and the tories but that is not of historic significance the important point is that britain s objections to the adams visit were well understood and found to be of less weight than immediate domestic politics this may have been an example of either turpitude or ineptness in the white house but it is nevertheless telling the us is becoming more concerned with pacific than european affairs when it does focus on the old continent it looks for strength and finds it in germany and france it seeks allies with an aspiration towards european union which it does not discern in london during most of the 20th century britain has been adept at juggling alliances making friends and influencing events in foreign office language punching above its weight it is something english diplomats traditionally do very well the consequent remnants of the glory years are often recounted britain remains a nuclear power although to what diplomatic advantage is unclear it still has its seat on the security council although few prudent punters would bet on it retaining this for another decade it is in nato although what that organisation is for is unclear it remains in the group of seven several many alphabeted european bodies and until 1997 hong kong none of this counts on its own britain s ability to influence events depends upon its skill at making bilateral alliances here with the us there with the french there again with the germans since the end of the cold war most politicians in most countries have been confused about foreign policy the disorientation of britain s perception of its global purpose is doubtless reflected in equivalent debates in washington bonn and would the french but admit it even

FT941-10748	ft 08 feb 94 arts betrayed by the system when it comes to teaching students how to draw we have been led astray by tom dick and harry	the idea of taking life drawing into secondary schools would seem as unexceptionable and high minded as could be and where better to celebrate it than in the fine rooms of the royal academy of arts bastion of the disciplined and objective study of the model since 1989 the outreach programme of the academy s education department has been sending graduates of the academy schools into secondary schools around the country to conduct day long workshops modern teach speak in life drawing there is no doubting the sincerity of all those involved in the programme nor that at the most basic level of interest and engagement some good has come of it the children range as the schools themselves decide from a level and art school aspirants to those who might never consider the art class to be anything but a good skive and all are worked extremely hard once the initial shock at being confronted by the nude figure has worn off that too proves salutary for we all have our bodies to live in and to look out at the model unsentimentally and unsalaciously is only to look at ourselves so far so good and on first sight the drawings now at the academy seem full of expressive life and energy but when we look again what else is there to see but expressive life and energy the truth begins to dawn that what we confront is not the fruit of study at all but of therapy made up to pass as study a great deal may well have been felt of sympathy excitement and release in the making of these drawings but what has been learnt and if learnt what remembered where is information that is actually retrievable usable what is so saddening is that here we might have had a programme that began at last to address the heresy that has betrayed art education at all levels these past 30 years instead we have its whole hearted embrace do your own thing express yourself be an artist have fun but if it requires any technical discipline or detached and objective critical consideration above all if it is difficult don t bother the game is given away at the start in an introductory display which offers a glib travesty of the argument a few dim and tired examples of the victorian academic life school are set up stump and smudge to show the bad dull old ways there is nothing of augustus john or sickert or tonks in the great slade tradition of life drawing instead in straight comparison oh brave new world sit those heroes of reform victor pasmore tom hudson harry thubron and richard hamilton whose example and polemic led directly to the reformation of the art schools in the 1960s chapter and verse are given in the catalogue right up until 1964 the last year of the old public examination for the national diploma in design the study of the figure was the central discipline of the art school the nude and costumed figure is studied in a variety of poses runs a ministry report of 1950 these usually last a full day but frequently short poses action poses or poses sustained during two or three days are substituted so that the student becomes familiar with the figure under a variety of conditions by these methods allied to a thorough study of anatomy it is hoped to equip the student with a sound working knowledge of the human figure and a technique adequate to its expression so it did this limited interpretation of drawing survived until the 1950s the catalogue goes on but then our tom dick harry and victor all intelligent men but manifestly indifferent draughtsmen knew better they engaged the student in processes of drawing which were exploratory and analytical as well as expressive the figure was no longer viewed as a static object to be pinned down and delineated it was a living complex form which could only be approached in an open and questioning manner drawing became a dynamic sequence of mark making which proposed certain ideas about form the eye searched intently the mind explored there were no prescribed answers ah there we have it no answers drawing at last as exploration and analysis open and questioning but no answers when i look back on my own unreformed days and weeks in the life room confronted by that fellow human being in living space whose form in all its subtle articulation had somehow to be rendered credibly and intelligibly onto the flat surface of the board i remember no simple descriptive exercise no pinning down and delineating there were relationships to measured shifts balances and tensions sympathetically to be felt and understood and a hand to be disciplined into making the marks that eye and brain required analysis exploration discovery expression of course and discipline and technique and here are these eager children on their hands and knees paper on the floor model on the move and nothing in fixed relation to anything else to be analysed or explored let alone expressed

pharmaceutical companies delays in getting a blockbuster compound to market give rivals time to launch price cutting imitations each day s hold up can cost a drug company dollars 1m pounds 600 000 in lost revenues as a result the race is on to bring in the latest computer technology to cut approval times clinical trials in particular have been targeted by the big pharmaceutical companies while many big drug companies are investing in personal computers or facsimile machines rhone poulenc rorer in the us has gone one step further it is conducting trials with pen computers electronic tablets reminiscent of a victorian school slate with a stylus or pen used for writing on the screen the software is usually displayed as forms with boxes that can be ticked or filled in eventually pen based machines could obviate the mountains of paperwork associated with drug trials these case record forms completed in triplicate can be up to 2cm thick for just one patient a typical trial would involve three phases with an average of 200 patients per trial rhone poulenc rorer part of rhone poulenc of france is using pen computers in a trial of antibiotics which began last december of the 30 to 40 sites involved eight will be using the pen computers to duplicate the paper system the aim says greg fromell associate director of clinical research in the us is to assess how much quicker the electronic system could be fromell sees two big areas of time saving first data entry transferring the paper based test results on to the computer is always a bottleneck data often have to be typed two or three times introducing errors and delays with the pen computer information is entered on the screen and can be transferred directly to the main database second researchers lose months correcting basic errors in paper data the software selected by rhone poulenc rorer from the german company padcom helps eliminate these if a number is required in response to a specific question the software will not allow the doctor to enter a letter or a tick the software can check the birth date of the patient to ensure that he or she is of the appropriate age to take part in the study or query information which appears to be outside the likely boundaries unlike a paper questionnaire although fromell believes that the breakthrough has been in the creation of computers that take handwritten information from companies such as grid ncr tandy and ibm of the us and nec and toshiba in japan he argues that it is not the hardware that will provide the competitive edge in drug trials but the software at casella the hoechst subsidiary in frankfurt clinical project manager dieter r dannhorn believes it is critical to have software which can guide doctors many of whom will be inexperienced in the use of computers through the form i need doctors who are happy with the system otherwise i am not going to get any patients for the trials casella has already conducted a short clinical trial with pen computers on 16 patients and is now planning clinical trials of an anti fungal product involving 240 patients in 10 centres with each patient questioned three times each doctor involved will receive a diskette to be completed on each patient visit for the rhone poulenc rorer trial diskettes will also be used to record patient information they will be posted to the central office where the data will be entered on the database in future the data could be sent automatically over a phone line while drugs companies believe it is too early to predict potential savings padcom s director of marketing peter munzel calculates that for a typical phase ii trial where the drug is tested for efficacy for the first time the savings could be more than 40 per cent if 10 centres and 200 patients were involved over a 12 month period with each patient visiting the doctor six times munzel calculates a saving of more than dollars 205 000 out of a total study cost of dollars 511 440 in reducing the number of queries and the need for retyping he argues that if pen computers were used throughout the drugs approval procedure they could cut a month off each study with an average of 30 studies per drug that could cut months or even years off the eight to 12 years it usually takes to get a drug approved giving companies an extra two or three years of sales of a compound before competitors flooded the market not everyone is so optimistic the challenge is to make major improvements in a whole host of areas says mark delfino a manager specialising in information technology with the boston consulting group in chicago a pen based system per se is only a more friendly interface and an easier way of getting data once the data comes in you still need a set of processes to handle it quickly although pen computers save time in data entry dannhorn calculates that unfamiliarity with writing case study books for pen pcs means that it takes him up to five times as long to write one for a pen computer as it does for a paper based trial drugs companies could be drawn into writing much of their own software with the need to set up expensive centres of technical expertise adds delfino in addition the cost of the hardware is not inconsequential he reckons it costs between dollars 5 000 and dollars 20 000 per site to equip trial sites with machines today s pen computers are often relatively heavy and have a short battery life so far there is no de facto operating system some companies favour that developed by the silicon valley start up go others prefer microsoft s windows for pen computing while some pharmaceutical companies have been quick to adopt pen computing others have strong reservations one concern is that handwriting recognition technology is still relatively primitive one of the biggest problems is legibility doctors have notoriously bad handwriting says stephen hill uk medical director for roche the swiss pharmaceuticals company he fears that data could be inaccurately recorded particularly in international trials conducted in english where english is not the first language of the doctors involved one of the biggest problems is to make sure that the information we collect matches the information on the patient s records continues hill if the data are entered directly by pc from the doctor s surgery to the company s main database without intermediary checking mistakes could slip through regulatory issues are also hampering the widespread take up of such systems at pfizer s uk operation in sandwich kent for example researchers are still waiting for a pronouncement from the us food and drug administration about the use of electronic signatures with paper trials the investigating doctor has to sign all the trial results to validate them but there are no guidelines about electronic signatures in germany the system is even more restrictive although the information from the casella trial will be recorded on screen german law requires that the results of the trials be printed out and signed by the doctor if the trial is to be valid at glaxo in the uk researchers are experimenting with pen based computers but believe it

FT941-10753	ft 08 feb 94 technology orphan quickly finds a home why a japanese drug company chose a tiny market	pharmaceutical companies have in recent years been concentrating on developing compounds for large markets the cost of developing a drug with a potential market of dollars 100m pounds 67m is not much less than a dollars 1bn one as a result most research and development directors have decided to concentrate on the big therapeutic categories where the rewards are likely to be greatest the drawback is that the large categories tend to be highly competitive and most require huge clinical trials this takes time an important consideration given that the patent life is limited and money fujisawa japan s fifth largest drugs group adopted an unusual approach for its latest compound prograf it deliberately developed the drug the first new immuno suppressant launched in 10 years for use in liver transplants only a relatively tiny area there are only about 20 liver transplants a year in japan the move appears strange because prograf is crucial to fujisawa s future eventually however the potential market for the drug is huge the main competitor is sandimmun a drug marketed by sandoz of switzerland with annual sales of about sfr1 3bn pounds 600m hitoshi oyashu managing director of fujisawa s r d division says the main reason for starting with a limited indication was to obtain orphan status a recent japanese law gives priority for orphan drugs treating diseases affecting no more than 50 000 people in theory orphan drugs are given priority during the ministry of health s review of the drug s safety and efficacy exclusive marketing rights for 10 years against six years for other drugs government r d subsidies tax exemptions on development costs even in the us the review procedure was markedly accelerated by choosing such a limited indication the compound was filed for use in liver transplants during september last year and declared approvable by an fda advisory committee within two months the company expects final approval this month an astonishingly quick process there are about 3 000 liver transplants in the us each year according to james capel uk stockbrokers in japan the second great advantage of such a narrow indication according to oyashu was that prograf was granted a substantial price premium to existing therapies in may 1992 the japanese ministry of health and welfare created a system of fixing new drug prices the only drugs allowed significant premiums to existing therapies would be those based on a new concept showing advantages in safety and usefulness and making a striking contribution compared with conventional treatments prograf is the only drug to have fulfilled those criteria since the rules were introduced in the meantime the company is using the wedge of the liver transplant indication to gain approval for kidney transplants and eventually other auto immune diseases such as eye disorders paget s disease and arthritis the company hopes to have approval for kidney transplants in japan during the second quarter of this year in the us it hopes the drug is approved by the fourth quarter of 1996 industry consultants say the market for prograf is already much larger than might be imagined once a drug is approved doctors prescribe it for other indications even though it might not be strictly licensed for them that helps with later marketing another advantage is that once the drug is in use regulatory authorities become less concerned about safety leaving the company free to prove efficacy this speeds up subsequent approvals however the r d director of one of japan s big groups says the advantage of high pricing only lasts when the indication is narrow
FT941-10754	ft 08 feb 94 management the growing business banks begin to face the facts in the second of a series on exporting richard gourlay and ian hamilton fazey consider the role of lenders	hardly a day goes by when uk industry is not encouraged to export with equal regularity there is a chorus of protest from exporters saying that banks do not understand their needs according to ian campbell director general of the institute of exports the biggest challenge exporters face is in dealing with their lenders finding flexible forms of finance comes before arranging insurance or even planning a marketing strategy banks understanding is very limited at the local level although there are good people at the head office says campbell a 1993 study by the institute showed that banks were the first call for advice on exporting for 80 per cent of smaller companies but 72 per cent of them said the advice they received was of no use one of the most common complaints from exporters was that banks lack adequate understanding of their customers foreign markets when exporting you need to be far more flexible if you are going to gain contracts says roger walker managing director of long products a manufacturer of anti corrosion and water proofing materials based in rye east sussex the company exports about 85 per cent of its pounds 3m annual sales ideally exporters should be in a position to offer a financing package when they go into negotiations with customers but many complain that their commercial position is undermined by their banks not matching the flexible finance offered by overseas competitors exporters cannot however be exonerated from all blame often they turn to their banks far too late in the day according to stuart natus head of international trade services at barclays bank it is common for customers to say i have something which is being shipped tomorrow how do i finance it or what can i do the letter of credit has not arrived alternatively companies may simply be talking to the wrong people in their banks it is unrealistic to expect most branch managers to be conversant with collection methods in italy for example while a number of banks are setting up business centres with a resident international trade specialist exporters need a far more professional approach to ensure their export finance is properly lined up companies should look at export finance quite separately from their ordinary retail banking needs says walker it is up to individuals to assess the quality of the banks and the people in the bank they are dealing with walker s knowledge of shopping around is the result of bitter experience four years ago long products had to turn away orders that cost the company pounds 400 000 of profits over two years with no warning his bank started withdrawing its export financing facility from the market giving him no time to make alternative arrangements the bank told walker that head office was trying to reduce its capital lending ratios after much research and an expensive two year transition walker now does his foreign business with barclays in london and his domestic banking with the royal bank of scotland when we unscrambled our banking arrangement we got our sales and profitability back up because we could go into the export market with renewed confidence he says whistling a tune composed in head office is not uncommon for local branch managers elaine thomson managing director of frederick thomson in crewe faced a similar situation with natwest having won a pounds 260 000 order to make specialist baking machinery from fazer of finland thomson says she was assured by her branch manager that he would provide a guarantee to return a deposit if the equipment was not shipped then on the instruction of the regional office in liverpool natwest said it would not issue the guarantee and frederick thomson lost the order thomson rescued the order when an insurance company agreed to provide the guarantee but only with the help of the bank relationship consultancy a group that advises companies how to get more from their banks natwest says thomson which had been losing money had unusual trading patterns and that the bank had tried to be as supportive as possible another significant problem is that uk banks when judging how much security a debtor book can support will usually ascribe no value to foreign debt receivables however large the customer unless they are backed by credit insurance when the banks take a charge over the assets they may allow 60 per cent against domestic debtors but nothing against overseas debts says mark runiewicz of the bank relationship consultancy barclays natus says the bank is currently considering changing its policy to take a more educated view of the risk of foreign debtors if the attitude is relaxed exporters would immediately be able to tap a new source of security against which to raise finance but as long as the policy remains companies will continue hiding their export receivables in their debtor book undermining the trust on which relations with banks is best built elsewhere there are signs that the banks may be responding to exporters needs after a gap of some years natwest has reintroduced an export finance scheme aimed at the smaller exporter whose overdraft is insufficient to support its foreign trade what is more there is growing recognition among banks that the service they offer exporters could be improved andy nemes of natwest s international trade and banking services division admits that the barrage of complaints at last year s exporter forums chaired by the financial times was an eye opener a former deputy head of the bank s staff training college nemes says natwest is going to modify its training programmes as a result of what he and his colleagues learned and the institute is working with natwest to devise a course for bank staff on exporting

FT941-10773	ft 08 feb 94 business and the law a question of ownership robert rice asks whether financial documents attract copyright protection	when richemont the swiss tobacco to luxury goods group reshuffled its assets last autumn to produce two separately focused businesses rothmans international and vendome luxury group copyright notices appeared on the inside cover pages of the listing particulars in the name of compagnie financiere richemont ag mr frederick mostert richemont s intellectual property counsel believes this is the first time that a company has openly claimed copyright protection for one of its financial documents richemont s move raises a question increasingly of concern to the financial community on both sides of the atlantic can copyright subsist in financial documents such as prospectuses offering circulars listing particulars and other financial documents required for public disclosure purposes or for filing with a stock exchange the issue has become controversial as companies that have spent considerable time and money on developing new financial products increasingly look for ways of protecting their investment in intellectual property certainly copyright protection exists for intellectual products in other areas of professional services such as architects plans barristers opinions cartographers maps scientists laboratory test sheets trade catalogues and listings so why not for financial documents the matter has never come before the english courts but in the us there has been a limited amount of litigation for infringement of copyright in financial products in 1982 in a case brought by dow jones a court ruled that a list of stocks in an index was protected by copyright in 1985 merritt forbes a securities underwriter and marketer which had registered a copyright for its reoffering circulars and supplements for tax exempt municipal bonds successfully sued newman investment securities and others for infringing the copyright by using substantially copied documents in an offering and last year a number of actions for infringement of copyrighted insurance forms was heard in us courts the increasing use of trademarks and service marks for new financial products such as lyons liquid yield option notes which is a trademark of merrill lynch and abc securities which is a registered service mark of kidder peabody also points to the increasing desire of companies to protect their intellectual creations but in spite such developments the extent to which copyright can subsist in financial documents remains largely untested copyright can subsist in financial documents to the extent that they constitute original works of authorship according to an article in the european intellectual property review by mr christopher morcom qc one of the uk s leading intellectual property lawyers mr roger zissu president of the us copyright society and a partner of new york law firm weiss dawid fross zelnick lehrman and mr mostert but there are limits to the material used in financial documents which can benefit from protection they add that while under both english and us law financial documents generally qualify for protection as original literary works the idea behind a financial product cannot be copyrighted protection extends only to the way that idea is expressed as a result to the extent that financial documents incorporate accounting methods financial systems or legal concepts they can be freely used by others provided they are not slavishly copied facts also cannot benefit from protection so financial data contained in balance sheets or income statements can be used freely and there is no protection for standard wording or boiler plate provisions in common use in the financial industry but in all other respects provided a financial document constitutes the expression of an original work it will attract copyright protection whether or not it is compiled from public sources and whether or not it includes a number of standard provisions say the authors infringement of copyright in financial documents will depend on the facts of each case if there has been slavish copying of substantial parts of a document the issue should be clear where the language and order of an original document have been changed the issue may be less obvious if the copyright owner can prove the alleged infringer has made use of the original work and despite changing the language has taken the heart or essence of a copyrighted work it might be possible to establish an infringement if on the other hand an alleged infringer has produced a document through original work using other public material and not by copying there will be no infringement even if the contents are similar in some respects according to mr zissu in cases that are too close to call the outcome is likely to be influenced by the court s sense of where the balance of fairness lies between the parties he points out however that although judges may be influenced in their decision by a sense of fair play none is likely to admit to it one of the most controversial areas of this debate is the question of ownership of the copyright in the documents and the right to use copyrighted material in subsequent documents says mr mostert as a general rule copyright vests in the author but what is the position when a group of companies produces a document setting out ideas for a financial reconstruction and sends it to a merchant bank or law firm for advice and revision the production of a derivative document should not affect the copyright in the original the lawyer or banker would not be free to copy the original document or use its contents to prepare derivative works for other clients but what if the derivative document is sufficiently original to merit its own copyright or the contributions of the original compiler and the lawyer who revises the original document cannot be separated so that the revised document becomes a work of joint authorship under english law says mr morcom when the work is prepared by a lawyer or a banker the usual position is that the author retains any copyright in the work subject to an implied licence for the person for whom it was prepared to use it for the purpose for which he or she requested it however where the work is derived from copyright material prepared and supplied by the client and the law firm or bank is being paid for preparing it it may be an implied term of the contract of engagement that copyright in the derivative work is assigned to the client the position is broadly similar in the us the authors stress however that each case will turn on its facts it is this uncertainty that is beginning to concern lawyers bankers and their corporate clients there is no doubt that copyright in financial documents is more on people s minds says mr morcom the ease with which documents can be stored on databases and reproduced has made them consider the issue more carefully in a recession where everyone is looking to cut costs there must be a temptation to save time by taking shortcuts he says so will litigation follow the issue is very controversial in the financial community says mr zissu someone s going to sue for breach of copyright in financial documents in the next year or two

FT941-10837	ft 08 feb 94 world trade news clinton budget brings back rosy scenario it is fiscally responsible but the spending projections are implausibly optimistic	president bill clinton delivered a fiscally responsible budget yesterday but the administration s projections of future spending trends look implausibly optimistic in an attempt to create room for increased investment in areas critical for american competitiveness such as education and training mr clinton is proposing a hard freeze on discretionary spending he envisages total discretionary spending rising from dollars 550 1bn in fiscal 1994 to dollars 554 4bn pounds 369 6bn in fiscal 1999 in cash terms less than 1 per cent and this is not to be achieved only through the continuing shrinkage of the defence budget which declines 13 per cent over this period mr clinton plans a total increase in non defence discretionary spending of only 9 9 per cent in cash terms over five years a substantial cut in real terms given that inflation of 3 0 3 5 per cent a year is expected over this period few industrial countries have achieved this kind of restraint on domestic programmes and there is little in us history to suggest it will be feasible between 1989 and 1994 such spending rose 45 per cent in cash terms the proposed freeze is the only way mr clinton can achieve the deficit reduction he promised while also modestly increasing public investment spending on mandatory or entitlement programmes such as healthcare and public sector pensions will continue to rise rapidly crowding out other expenditure mandatory spending will rise 4 4 per cent in the coming year against less than 1 per cent for non defence discretionary spending over the next five years mandatory spending is projected to rise from dollars 730 4bn to dollars 1 020 5bn or 40 per cent it is optimism on spending that permits mr clinton to project sharp declines in federal borrowing in spite of last year s tax increases on the wealthy total receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product are projected to decline slightly over the next five years from 18 8 per cent of gdp to 18 6 per cent spending however is expected to fall from 22 3 per cent of gdp to 20 9 per cent the deficit is expected to decline from dollars 234 5bn 3 5 per cent of gdp in fiscal 1994 to a trough of dollars 173 1bn in fiscal 1996 2 3 per cent of gdp it then begins to creep higher exceeding dollars 200bn by fiscal 1999 none of these figures allows for the impact of this year s main legislative priority reform of healthcare a sector that accounts for 14 per cent of gdp mr clinton s plan would extend health cover to uninsured americans 15 per cent of the population and guarantee a generous package of benefits for everyone according to white house estimates these additional costs would be largely offset by parallel measures to reduce the rate of growth of spending such as the creation of large purchasing co operatives and caps on growth in private sector insurance premiums the administration estimates that if mr clinton s health plan were implemented mandatory spending would grow by 45 per cent over five years a little faster than the 40 per cent projected without reform with the plan mandatory spending would rise from 11 per cent of gdp today to 12 per cent in fiscal 1999 without it mandatory spending would rise to 11 7 per cent the white house figures again look optimistic but any calculations are hypothetical because it appears unlikely that mr clinton s health plan will be enacted in its original form congress seems likely to favour less ambitious reforms which scale back the level of guaranteed health benefits but which also impose fewer direct controls on spending growth the stress on fiscal discipline in mr clinton s budget is ostensibly balanced by a commitment to higher public investment as a means of boosting growth and improving the prospects of disadvantaged groups but both elements of the equation are exaggerated the proposed axing of more than 100 programmes sounds impressive but it will save only about dollars 3bn in a dollars 1 500bn budget congress in any case is unlikely to approve many of the cuts the investment agenda includes planned increases in spending on workforce security improved access to skill training and job search education including an expansion of the pre school head start programme commercial technology physical infrastructure and the environment few will argue with this shift of priorities but the scale of the investment effort falls far short of mr clinton s promises during the presidential election campaign the president is asking congress to approve an additional dollars 13 7bn in spending this year on his main investment proposals that represents less than 1 per cent of the budget it is a change only at the margin mr clinton s claim to have dispensed with republican smoke and mirrors in his economic forecast seems only partly justified the white house is projecting steady economic growth of 2 5 3 0 per cent for the rest of the decade reducing the jobless rate to 5 5 per cent even though this would represent one of the longest unbroken business upswings on record it assumes the federal reserve will allow consumer price inflation to creep higher from 2 8 per cent last year to nearly 3 5 per cent by 1997 the greatest optimism is reserved for interest rates the white house expects three month rates to remain 3 5 per cent or less throughout this year and more surprising still to average less than 4 5 per cent every year until 1999 the yield on 10 year bonds is assumed never to rise above 6 per cent this is indeed a rosy scenario the budget s economic assumptions calendar years actual projections 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999

FT941-10853	ft 08 feb 94 japan tackles growing drugs bill attempts to control a big part of rising healthcare costs	japan s ministry of health and welfare has been afflicted by the global epidemic of rising healthcare costs the problem this makes for budgets is particularly acute in japan which has an ageing population and falling tax receipts whereas in 1990 only 11 7 per cent of the population was over 65 the lowest proportion among the world s seven richest countries by 2025 that figure will have more than doubled to nearly 24 per cent this ageing population and medical inflation running at about 7 per cent a year would be less serious if the japanese economy was growing but the exchequer is suffering from wilting tax receipts during the worst recession since the second world war we don t know exactly what the ministry is going to do says ms teruko onoda drugs analyst at merrill lynch says but whatever it is will have to be drastic japan s health and welfare ministry like those elsewhere has found the drugs bill a tempting target for savings medicines represent a particularly large target in japan although pharmaceuticals account for 1 5 per cent of gross national product they represent about 30 per cent of healthcare spending far more than in western countries the ministry has adopted a two prong strategy against the drugs bill attacking both prices and demand the ministry s long term aim is to reduce spending on medicines from about 28 per cent of the y24 340bn pounds 146bn health bill to only 20 per cent according to the japan pharmaceutical manufacturers association the ministry is continuing its policy of cutting prices every two years but this year it has added special cuts for fast growing products initial fears that the price of some drugs could be cut by as much as 30 per cent have not been realised but these new cuts have nonetheless drawn an angry response from the industry mr jacques racloz president of sandoz yakuhin the subsidiary of the swiss group said the special price cuts were an emotional reaction triggered by politics it s worrying because they re not based on the existing system and appears arbitrary there s also a danger they could represent a precedent each time a drug becomes successful it could be hammered under the every other year price cutting scheme introduced two years ago drugs judged innovative would be allowed a premium over existing therapies of up to 30 per cent while less innovative but still novel compounds would receive premiums of between 1 5 per cent and 4 5 per cent the industry was dismayed to discover the ministry s criteria were so strict that over the last decade only four or five drugs would have qualified for the full premium we have to have more flexibility said mr bryan wright japan representative of the us pharmaceutical manufacturers association there needs to be something between 30 per cent and the lower band otherwise there s little incentive to develop innovative products while the price cuts and controls on new products are designed to have an immediate impact in the longer term the ministry is trying to control demand for medicines so far the main methods which have not proved particularly successful are separating the prescribing and dispensing of medicines a substantial proportion of hospitals income comes through dispensing doctors negotiate discounts from wholesalers but are reimbursed by the government at the full price the more doctors prescribe the higher their income between a third and a quarter of doctors earnings depend on prescribing discounts ending up in doctors pockets may account for an astonishing y1 000bn a year according to one analyst so far the ministry s efforts have made little impression only 15 per cent of hospitals have separated prescribing from dispensing of medicines and many of these are cheating by setting up new pharmacies next door fixed price contracts for chronic care of the elderly hospitals are paid a fixed amount for treating certain conditions the hospitals margins therefore depend on keeping down costs some analysts believe this could lead to a large increase in the prescribing of cheap generic non patented drugs however only 5 per cent of hospitals have adopted this system switching responsibility for negotiating discounts from the drugs manufacturers to the wholesalers the theory is that wholesalers will be less inclined than pharmaceuticals companies to discount products this should reduce doctors margins on prescribing and so reduce volumes the japan pharmaceutical manufacturers association estimates discounts narrowed from 23 per cent to 18 per cent but have now risen back to about 20 per cent even though the demand side controls are yet to be fully effective the ministry s efforts appear to be bearing fruit by the middle of last year data from ims japan the market research group showed growth of the drugs market over a 12 month moving period was only 3 per cent nevertheless the ministry s continuing battle to control spending is likely to intensify slowing the growth of the japanese drugs market further for manufacturers the consequent pain may be hard to bear most analysts are predicting rationalisation
FT941-10854	ft 08 feb 94 death of banker who helped shape west germany the career of hermann josef abs was one of the most brilliant of the century but marred by his close links to the third reich	hermann josef abs who died at the weekend aged 92 personified both the triumphs and some of the problems of german business during the past 60 years during his post war heyday as head of deutsche bank the country s largest bank mr abs won renown as the quintessential german banker using his network of directorships and influence to play a significant role in rebuilding the west german economy a man whose mild appearance belied his capacity for hard work and occasional ruthlessness mr abs stood for many years at the centre of corporate germany aged only 36 he became a member of the deutsche bank management board in 1938 a position in which he stayed throughout the second world war he remained deutsche bank s honorary chairman up to his death not least because of his war time role he ranked among the most controversial bankers of the century as well as one of the most outstanding abs was the chairman of deutsche bank s management board between 1957 and 1967 and headed the supervisory board for a subsequent decade until 1976 the influence of deutsche bank and the country s other big universal banks on germany s corporate and financial life has been modified since abs ceased to play an active role in deutsche bank s affairs in an increasingly integrated europe the banks domination of the securities industry and their strong corporate links now look less pronounced than in the immediate post war period deutsche bank none the less retains a pivotal position in the german economy a tribute to the capacity of abs and his contemporaries to rebuild the country s big banks after the war along the lines of traditions laid down when they were established in the 1870s one of germany s post war traditions is that deutsche bank has periodically attracted praise and vilification in roughly equal measure abs once termed by david rockefeller the world s leading banker was also labelled a richelieu he was frequently exposed to criticism that he enjoyed too much power for germany s own good whatever may be said against the traditional german system of universal banks combining roles as lenders traders of securities and long term share owners it has achieved an accomplished track record stretching back more than a century by allowing banks and industry to build up and extend long term relationships the system that abs helped restore after the war allowed west germany for a long time to overcome short term economic vicissitudes with greater success than most of its european trading partners that system is now being put to a crucial test as a result of the trials of german unification virtually throughout his career abs followed a steeply rising path he was born into a comfortably off catholic family in bonn on october 15 1901 after a false start on a quickly abandoned university law course he turned to banking his apprenticeship took him to london paris amsterdam and the americas in 1935 at the age of 34 he became a partner in a well known berlin private bank delbruck schickler co within three years he joined deutsche bank at the time a frontline institution but not yet the biggest in germany his more senior german colleagues recognised early abs capacity and judgment in international banking matters one of his pre war accomplishments was to help represent germany at negotiations to freeze the banks foreign debts in view of his intelligence sardonicism and catholic background abs was regarded with hostility by the more rabid members of the nazi party he was never a party member but throughout the war he remained close to some of the technocrats running parts of the nazi economy as a professional associate of walter funk the reichsbank president he was a member until 1945 of the reichsbank s advisory council in spring 1945 as the war neared an end in berlin abs left the german capital bound for hamburg in a karstadt department store delivery lorry crammed with deutsche bank files after a short lived appointment as an adviser to the british military government he was imprisoned by the americans for three months and was proposed in 1948 as the first head of the bank deutscher lander the nascent federal bank and the forerunner of the bundesbank he turned the job down above all it seems because the us occupation authorities had made clear they would not have him abs ambivalent war time activities remained controversial to his death unlike many germans of his generation abs never claimed to have resisted hitler a man who was not imprisoned or hanged or shot by the nazis cannot claim to have opposed hitler he once said deutsche bank helped the nazis confiscate jewish property and assets in the late 1930s and 1940s as part of the aryanisation laws abs had also been on the supervisory board of ig farben the conglomerate with a stake in the chemicals company that developed the zyklon b gas used to kill millions of jews in gas chambers after 1945 abs helped some jewish clients who had escaped the death camps to recover compensation from the bonn government but he also had to challenge in a german court assertions made in a 1970 book that he had participated in forced sales and expropriation of jewish property the court found none of the book s accusations valid in 1983 as a result of criticism of his pre 1945 activities abs suffered the ignominy of being put on a us government watch list of undesirable aliens and was officially barred from entering the us however this did not according to the deutsche bank prevent him from making periodic us trips abs real post war career began in 1953 when in a milestone marking west germany s reintegration into the community of nations he negotiated the london agreement restructuring germany s foreign indebtedness in a step which freed germany from the burden of reparations that had blemished the survival chances of the weimar republic germany s debts were written down and allowed to be repaid between 1953 and 1983 an accord that became a model for many subsequent rescheduling agreements abs was also appointed head of kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau the german reconstruction bank that channelled assistance from the marshall plan to west germany s war damaged economy abs went on to head the southern german group of the three banks into which the allies had split deutsche bank there he engineered the reunification of the three successors becoming head of the reconstituted deutsche bank s executive board in 1957 during this time abs build up his close relationship with konrad adenauer the first west german chancellor in office between 1949 and 1963 a fellow rhinelander sharing abs mordant wit and his taste for power abs was once asked whether the rumour was true that the old man had once asked him to become foreign minister abs oblique reply was when adenauer really wanted something he didn t ask you he told you abs was fluent in three languages and had a working knowledge of three more he spoke the clipped sometimes slightly archaic english of a country squire gentle in tone acid in content his capacity for work was legendary he claimed that for weeks on end he could work every day habitually at a stand up desk from 8am until midnight on top of this he found time to collect french impressionists and to head committees running beethoven s birthplace in bonn and goethe s in frankfurt if abs voice was conservative it was also that of a classic banking paternalist one of his recurring themes was that business must serve the community a much repeated aphorism was that profits were no end in themselves to conduct business for profit alone would be like living only to breathe society would tolerate private business only if it could prove that profits for the enterprise created benefits for society that may be dismissed as german corporatism yet abs was no particular friend of the german laws giving trade unions and workers representatives a voice in management he thought management methods needed to change periodically to give all employees an interest in their company as early as the 1950s he warned that currencies should not be kept strong mainly by high interest rates he tried and failed to use his influence with the bonn government in 1961 to 1969 to prevent the two 1960s d mark revaluations steps that he viewed as harmful to germany s export oriented industry by 1970 mindful of the requirement for durable european monetary arrangements he was talking of the need for a european central bank his experience of the third reich explained part of abs caution over expanding deutsche bank into foreign countries he believed that co operation with foreign banks rather than outright takeovers marked the most appropriate course as memories of war receded and a new generation took over the helm deutsche bank s policy became more adventurous the most dramatic international move came at the end of 1989 when deutsche bank bought the uk s morgan grenfell for pounds 950m much increasing its clout in areas such as international mergers and acquisitions the bank justified the move in the sort of under stated terms much used by abs deutsche bank could learn much about investment banking from its new london subsidiary at the peak during the post war period abs was a member of 24 supervisory boards in germany so many that a law was passed in 1965 limiting bankers board appointments the two tier system of management and supervisory board was and is the foundation upon which bank influence over industrial and other concerns is based in the 1960s abs teamed up with professor karl schiller the social democratic economics minister to use his prestige and contacts to devise a network of warranties which saved the krupp concern from almost certain bankruptcy he also helped to engineer the transaction in the 1970s by which kuwait bought a stake in daimler benz from the flick family when it lost interest in controlling the star performer of german industry in the post abs era even some deutsche bank directors have recognised that the traditional system may be a bit too cosy forecasting that eventually the banks will run down their shareholdings in industry deutsche bank executives still however are thought to hold around 140 seats on supervisory boards around the country during his great days abs was probably as popular as it is possible for any banker to be towards the end of his life he did not however hold either politicians or the great majority of his compatriots in great regard he believed the exaggerated demand for social welfare in west germany s comfortable consensus society was a severe hindrance to economic dynamism as west germany approached the challenge of unification abs in crisply delivered interviews at the end of the 1980s liked to berate the west germans inflexibility and voice doubt about their capacity for hard work they want to work less and have more free time was one of his complaints in his latter years as the world hummed around him abs plainly did not enjoy having an inordinate amount of time on his hands if he was faintly disdainful of modern

FT941-10895	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 32 figuring out the differences accounting and reporting	of all the countries in all the world very few offer investors a consistent or comparable set of accounting standards to help them interpret financial performance the pitfalls in attempting to interpret different sets of accounts and negotiating through the widely varying tax structures pose considerable challenges many emerging markets have less formalised accounting standards varying degrees of disclosure and different underlying philosophies which affect the figures a number of commentators divide the world between tax driven accounts and accounts more geared to investors the former may often have the incentive to keep published profits low the latter to boost them for countries in the former category the published accounts are those that are submitted to the revenue authorities countries often have relatively hidebound fixed formats governed by legislation or charts of accounts the latter category includes the uk and the us where tax returns are separate and even contradictory and accounts are geared primarily towards investors mr john tetley a member of the consultative group of the international accounting standards committee iasc who has particular knowledge of french and portuguese speaking africa and south america says the differences between countries can cause quite a lot of trouble if you are thinking of investing in family owned local businesses you have very little idea what the accounts mean he says they report what they want to he argues that many have relatively few accountants or bookkeepers let alone consistent standards which they can apply policies vary on the revaluation of assets on depreciation and the treatment of foreign currency in particular he highlights the role of indexation in high inflation countries such as mexico brazil and argentina which can make comparisons confusing you are never quite sure what you are looking at he says a survey conducted last year by the centre for international financial reporting and analysis cifar pointed out a number of difficulties in interpreting international financial statements the information on companies in emerging markets is limited and often filed long after the year end many subsidiaries conduct transactions with parent companies adding to the awkwardness of extracting relevant timely data english translations of annual reports and other financial information are often unavailable or unreliable converting figures expressed in local currencies may prove problematic varying year ends makes comparison difficult and auditing standards vary that is before accounting standards cifar cites eight particular issues treated in vastly divergent ways across the globe depreciation inventory methods deferred taxes consolidation principles discretionary reserves inflation adjustments foreign currency translation and the valuation of fixed income and equity securities some see signs of optimism for the future from the work of the iasc which has been attempting over many years to establish a set of standards transcending national differences some countries have adopted iasc standards wholesale or developed their own versions based on the same international approach for example the hong kong stock exchange last year issued new rules requiring foreign incorporated companies to present reports in line with iasc standards they have been incorporated into requirements in pakistan zimbabwe malaysia kenya and india the asian development bank and the united nations intergovernmental working group of experts on international standards of accounting and reporting have used iasc standards however iasc standards have been criticised for the political compromises necessary to build consensus between different countries standards the result has been a wide range of alternative treatments which did little to improve ease of interpretation for readers of accounts that has now begun to change significantly with the organisation s comparability improvements project designed to bring about greater harmonisation the motivation has been partly to gain recognition for iasc standards from the international organisation of securities commissions iosco which would allow far wider recognition of the standards in different national stock exchanges the strategy has begun to pay off with iosco now endorsing the iasc cash flow statement standard for example but more wholesale ratification is likely to be a long way off to add to the confusion some of the national accounting standards setters are also beginning to become more interested in international collaboration in a way that may threaten the iasc s traditional role standards setters from the uk us canada france australia and elsewhere have in the past two years begun discussing sharing the workload for research and standards drafting on a number of topics there are still wider concerns that iasc and other national standards were devised in the developed world and may be far less appropriate without substantial modification in many of the emerging markets regions meanwhile investors need to bear in mind tax issues within emerging markets mr peter dickinson international tax partner with coopers lybrand in london says one of the key tax questions in emerging markets is how to get one s money out you need to understand the exchange control regulations he says a lot of countries have very tight controls such as south africa and india in addition he says there may be specific stipulations on how money is held through the banks within countries there are often federal regional state or city taxes to be considered then there is the small print in the double taxation treaties agreed between the investor s country and the country for investment which may impinge on returns there is a much higher degree of risk in emerging markets says mr dickinson investors should think long and hard at their potential after tax returns he says the most important factor for investors tends to be withholding taxes on dividends paid outside the country in addition the position is far from static the rules keep changing he says in some countries like china the rules on how much tax to pay move from one month to the next international

FT941-10896	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 31 foreign investors take stock privatisation	with the rise and rise of the world s emerging markets foreign investors have naturally been showing keen interest in privatisation issues in singapore last october for instance the government s flotation of a 10 per cent stake in the telecommunications utility was some 10 times subscribed and the stock exchange extended its hours on the first day of trading to cope with the demand offered at sdollars 2 00 the shares initially rose to sdollars 5 00 and now trade at around sdollars 3 60 making it by far the largest company in terms of market capitalisation nearby in bangkok telecomasia also became the largest capitalised company on thailand s stock exchange when its shares were publicly traded for the first time in december the shares closing the first session more than double the bt55 dollars 2 15 offer price the shares are now trading around the bt130 level while there was considerable domestic interest in these two issues demand was really fuelled by overseas investors looking for opportunities in what became a spectacular rally from the third quarter onwards for emerging markets in general kleiman international consultants a us based consultancy which monitors emerging markets reported earlier this month that oecd data found portfolio investment from the west and japan climbed by half in 1992 the last time data was available to dollars 94bn outstripping official finance of dollars 60bn for the first time the main reason for this was due to the extent of liberalisation and privatisation in the emerging economies kleiman notes that globally dollars 70bn was transferred from state to private hands in 1993 with latin america making up 30 per cent of that figure it was not however a coincidence that telecommunications has been among the first sectors to take off since it is an area to which emerging economies have been giving priority for growth among the regions latin america has been leading the way according to baring securities market growth in this sector for the period 1990 1995 is estimated at 12 per cent just exceeding the 11 per cent forecast for south east asia by comparison the same source estimates something like 4 per cent growth in europe and 2 per cent in north america taken in context latin america s lead is not so surprising since over the past few years the authorities in argentina mexico chile and venezuela have sold majority shares in the national telephone utilities meanwhile foreign investors are awaiting opportunities elsewhere particularly in brazil where telebras the state owned group is seen as a sell off candidate however the privatisation process in brazil ran into difficulties at the end of last year when the government was forced to cancel the auction of petroquimica uniao a petrochemical company this embarrassing situation the first time an auction had been cancelled in the country since 1991 arose after it was revealed that less than 7 per cent of the shares on offer had been bought the auction was finally completed on january 27 this contrasts with the sale of the argentine government s 45 per cent stake in june 1993 of oil and gas group ypf which has claims to being the oldest state oil company in the world this was the second and by far the largest of the state s privatisations of its main energy groups raising some dollars 3bn including an international tranche of some dollars 2 3bn the country s first sale was of federal gas and electricity companies in 1992 and the last the sale of hidronor the hydroelectricity generator which raised dollars 1 1bn ypf was heavily subscribed by the foreign community being a high quality stock which is also traded in new york access is also helped by argentina s deregulated market environment with no restrictions placed on access or repatriation of funds and the fact that unlike many of the region s economies it has a stable currency which is pegged to the dollar the oil group now the most active issue in buenos aires with a market capitalisation of around dollars 8 5bn saw its shares rise steadily in the first weeks of trading before settling down to the dollars 25 level one third above the flotation price because of its listing in new york most of the trade is now of the arbitrage kind one estimate has put the amount at some dollars 80m a day with investors constantly searching for new investment opportunities eastern and central european countries have become popular with many of that region s markets showing strong gains during 1993 in poland for example the equity market comprising just 22 shares soared last year demonstrating gains of some 700 per cent in dollar terms and such enthusiasm has spilled over into hungary and the czech republic privatisation is the key word to the region s performance in poland the government has pledged that it will give this area top priority with between 20 30 national investment funds run by foreign and domestic investment managers being set up to control the first round of privatisation last year the sale of a 30 per cent stake in bank slaski one of the nine state owned banks being sold through the government s privatisation of banks was greatly over subscribed and the shares started trading at 13 5 times the 500 000 zloty dollars 23 offer price research often one important difficulty with emerging markets is improving with brokers such as smith new court imi securities and creditanstalt the austrian bank active in poland the czech republic has also excited interest among foreign investors as its voucher privatisation scheme takes off with shares in more than 1 300 companies being distributed between 8m voucher holders a second round of privatisation involving more than 700 companies worth nearly dollars 5bn is also under way most of the vouchers have been deposited with investment funds capitalising on interest in this region

amount anticipated up to 20 per cent of the fund will be invested in eastern and central europe
FT941-10897	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 28 calculated risks for higher rewards performance measures	it is not difficult to see why emerging market investments have caught on the best performing emerging market funds last year made returns of more than 100 per cent while the top 20 funds over the past three years have all returned more than 200 per cent according to micropal which tracks funds performance meanwhile interest rates in developed countries are approaching their cyclical lows and although economic growth is starting to pick up in some western countries it is expected to remain slow investors are becoming increasingly willing to venture further afield to enhance their returns but the rewards offered by emerging market investments are inevitably accompanied by greater risks and the first time investor may find it difficult not only to select a market but also to track performance emerging markets are both less liquid and more volatile than investments in established stock and bond markets they are also less transparent and often subject to restricted access for foreign investors even for the institutional fund manager investments in emerging markets are a complicated affair while a fund manager in the uk stock or bond market can if he so desires replicate the ft se index or a gilts index and then try to outperform them indices on emerging markets are more complex among existing bond indices jp morgan s liquid brady bond index and latin american eurobond index are widely followed but these and other bond indices include only a relatively small portion of the potential universe of investments in one sense this has favoured the performance of bond fund managers because it has made it relatively easy to outperform such indices this is because the indices tend to cover the most liquid least volatile and therefore lower risk bonds however investors need to be aware of the risks involved in investments in markets where for example there may be a high level of political instability no index is perfect says mr marc wenhammar head of fixed income at latin american securities the emerging markets division of foreign and colonial the problem is that the markets change so quickly and have enormous access and liquidity constraints you can t have an index that reflects all that for example he points out that many latin american bond indices are heavily weighted towards mexican bonds and may not include more esoteric paper such as that of peru latin american securities adopts a three pronged approach to achieve a balanced measurement of its performance first managers do not use a single index but look at a number of benchmarks second they look at their peer group that is similar funds with which they are competing third they try to set targets in terms of the type of risks return on investment volatility and so on we are not just selling returns we want to sell a good risk return investment he says some people don t necessarily want the highest returns but are keen to have controlled volatility agreeing the parameters of investment in emerging markets is therefore a vital part of the fund manager s service to a client it s a difficult thing for a fund manager and an end investor to get to grips with agrees one london based emerging markets salesman what risk is the fund manager allowed to take the eurobond and brady bond indices are just a guide stick you have to decide whether the fund manager will be able to throw in algeria and the ivory coast he points out that the prospectus for a specific fund always sets out in detail what the constraints on investment are but for both bond and equity markets the problem is not merely one of selection but also of access many markets particularly equity markets which tend to be more politically sensitive are partially or largely closed to foreign investors in many emerging markets much of the market capitalisation is not available to a foreign investor says mr bruce johnson head of global research at baring securities whose emerging equity market indices are among the most widely followed in setting up its index baring tried to take account not only of market size and volume but also of whether stocks are investable or available many markets have a series of legal restrictions on the total amount a single investor may hold in any one company the total amount foreigners can hold in any one company and the total amount all foreigners can own in the market overall there can also be tax and other difficulties for example forcing investors to hold stocks for as long as three years or treating capital gains inconsistently other issues include the convertibility of the domestic currency and the fact that some foreign held stocks trade at a premium mr johnson points out that although stocks may be legally available there may be practical restrictions on their availability due to illiquidity there are some ways round restrictions and illiquidity problems such as buying american depositary receipts adrs however there is a danger of a mis match between adrs and the domestic market other methods of circumventing regulations include buying country funds or using swaps or bonds with embedded options the baring index places some importance on the ease of replicating the index to this end the market turnover has to be at least dollars 2bn a year pakistan for example is a borderline case other leading equity indices such as those compiled by morgan stanley place greater emphasis on economic criteria the smallest market

FT941-10898	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 30 a new asset class created debt trading	out of the disaster of the latin american debt crisis of the 1980s a number of big international banks have created a booming business in issuing and trading emerging markets debt the skills learned have been transferred to the far eastern markets and now some of the banks hope that the same pattern can be repeated in eastern europe from the rubble of the sovereign lending boom that originated in the petrodollar recycling bubble of the 1970s the international banks have ingeniously created a new class of high yielding international debt instruments they may be of uncertain creditworthiness in the long run but they are immediately attractive to income starved investors we are at the forefront of recognising that emerging markets are global says mr jorge jasson senior vice president in charge of the emerging markets group at chase investment bank in new york we have dedicated our resources to the asset class chase is by no means alone big us banks such as citicorp and jp morgan which sweated for years over their latin american exposures are now cashing in elsewhere one of the few european banks to have persevered in latin america during the bad times is the dutch based ing and it is now seeking to make its experience count in europe where it has for instance just bought a stake in bank slaski in poland ing expanded in latin america while other international banks were retreating says mr jacques kemp chairman of its international division now we are doing the same in eastern europe he adds there is a global transformation as multinationals transfer to emerging countries for the next five years there will be more growth in the non oecd economies especially in comparison with western europe the next generation will talk about the problems of the first world rather than the third world the trading of emerging markets debt has now become an important activity based principally in new york and london there are indications that trading teams are also being established in hong kong to develop the far east market an emerging markets traders association has been established to provide a self regulatory framework in which common standards can be developed and to complement the 15 or 20 international banks which handle most of the trading a network of inter dealer brokers has sprung up to improve the flow of information brokers are in the process of installing live screens a reflection of the fact that emerging markets debt is no longer a thinly traded fringe market but now operates on a comparable basis to the mainstream securities markets such as first world government paper one of the leading brokers mr martin quintin archard says that the development of the legal documentation by the market has been a significant advance you can assign a loan without a thought he remarks mr quintin archard who is managing director of debt trading at intercapital in london says that the latin american crisis was of fundamental importance in that it taught the banks to trade loans if there is another crisis like this elsewhere you already have the blueprint he says bank regulators may regard this with misgivings the reported readiness of certain banks to trade distressed debt in cases such as euro disney may hamper crisis management yet the banks are making considerable fortunes out of latin america one result however is that there is a serious shortage of skilled traders there s tremendous movement in the market says mr quintin archard entire teams are being lifted the big boom came last year although the climate had been rapidly improving since 1990 and many latin american governments and corporate borrowers regained access to the international markets in 1991 it was in 1993 that the big payoff was seen in emerging market debt a cascade of money mainly from us institutions arrived seeking high returns in the face of slumping yields on us treasuries and similar top grade paper the inflows generated their own lucrative price spirals and the average return on brady bonds for instance was around 44 per cent the action more recently has been shifting to still more speculative debt in anticipation for instance of brady type restructurings yet to come mr jacques kemp of ing comments that a lot of bank provisions are being written back and in fact latin america s overall credit record in the past 10 years has been quite good certainly in comparison with the extensive bad debts which banks suffered in the developed countries between 1989 and 1992 but are investors losing sight of the credit risks the collapse of banco latino venezuela s second largest commercial bank a few weeks ago provided a reminder of the problems the latino failure was a one off insists mr jasson but he agrees that a lot of paper is coming to the market without a credit rating and without consistent quality there is an over enthusiasm to bring to market issues that don t meet international standards he says you should be very selective mr kemp is also wary about the extent of the securitisation of the debts which raises questions about who exactly will be holding the paper when future defaults occur we are concerned that there will be an over extension of credit in the next few years he says but most of the issues are in the private sector which has a much better record than the public sector the markets have been steering clear of major issues for the governments now the game moves on once international emerging market debt much better sounding than junk bonds has been established as an asset class there is enormous scope to supply an ever broader range of product there is rapidly increasing interest from global investors who have a greater need to diversify their holdings says mr jasson mr kemp has his eyes on the potential of eastern europe his bank has 2 000 staff there and it hopes to open a branch in moscow later this year latinos are now investing in east european debt because they feel there are some common trends he says a rise in status can be very profitable for investors as latin america has shown east europe will have to start at spreads of 300 400 basis points but they will fall mr kemp predicts
FT941-10899	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 29 investors spoilt for choice specialist funds	the investor who decides to back his or her favourite emerging market is spoilt for choice according to micropal s emerging markets monitor there were nearly 500 emerging markets equities funds at the start of 1994 twenty one funds were devoted to indonesia alone these funds are often based in offshore centres such as luxembourg or the cayman islands to maximise their tax efficiency the majority are denominated in us dollars although some are in sterling and some in the local currency emerging markets funds fall into three obvious categories the global the regional and the single country the former have been both extremely popular and successful they have a number of attractive arguments on their side the first is that there are simply so many emerging markets that it is difficult for individuals or even institutions to keep track of them all it makes more sense to sub contract the task to a specialist manager the second argument is that individual emerging markets are highly volatile by investing in a spread of emerging markets via a global fund one can reduce this volatility this factor is reinforced by evidence which shows that emerging markets are not correlated with each other in other words there is no reason why the brazilian and the turkish stock markets should move in the same direction therefore an investor can benefit from the phenomenon of greater economic growth and therefore faster increases in corporate profits without increasing risk regional funds also have some advantages for investors who do not feel confident enough about choosing individual markets in asia or latin america single country funds have a more mixed reputation inevitably they will be more volatile than global funds but they offer a focused investment route for those who want to back the growth of a particular market say mexico in the wake of the north american free trade agreement the reputation of the single country sector was damaged by the establishment of a number of closed end funds in the late 1980s these funds often based offshore but with a london listing were designed to tap institutional investor enthusiasm for individual usually far eastern stock markets problems arose because such funds were often launched when an individual market was the height of fashion in some countries a few authorised funds represented the only route for outside institutional investors to gain exposure to the market in their early days some funds moved quickly to stand at premiums to asset values however when such markets subsequently fell out of favour the asset value of the funds dropped furthermore the closed end nature of these funds meant that investors could only sell their shares in the market a combination of illiquidity and out of favour markets meant that shares dropped to discounts to asset values these could be as wide as 35 40 per cent in the early 1990s there were rumblings of discontent from some institutions who felt that brokers were neglecting the needs of existing investors some believed brokers were interested only in the substantial fees available for launching funds they were less concerned about doing something to rescue investors when their holdings stood at a discount one or two attempts were made to unitise closed end funds which stood at a discount a device which would allow investors to realise their holdings at asset value but the discount factor was also attacked by a number of predatory investors who built up large stakes in funds at high discounts with the aim of provoking managers into action and earning a handsome profit a general narrowing of discounts followed enhancing investors returns at a time of generally buoyant stock markets city of london emerging markets a unit trust which specialises in buying the shares of single country funds produced returns of 236 per cent over the two years to january 1 1994 offer to bid with net income reinvested source hardwick stafford wright making it the best performing international growth trust over the period it is also top of its sector over one year and second over three and five years nevertheless the volatility of the discounts in the single country fund sector inevitably raises the question of whether it is better to construct such funds on an open or closed end basis an open ended fund constructed as a unit trust or mutual fund avoids the discount problem however were an emerging market to crash sharply the open ended fund manager would have a problem his investors would be rushing to redeem their holdings and he would have to offload stock on to an illiquid and fast plunging market the manager of a closed ended fund can sit tight however since his investors cannot sell their shares back to him in essence the closed end structure passes the liquidity risk on to the investor in the form of the danger of a discount however the fans of closed end funds argue that the freedom given to closed end managers should improve their performance and thus the return to the investor in the long run the debate could become louder if the securities and investments board goes ahead with proposals to replace its list of approved securities and derivatives markets with a general duty on unit trust managers to ensure that the markets in which they invest meet certain criteria the old system has restricted the freedom of uk unit trust managers to invest in certain emerging markets and thus has limited the number of onshore single country funds the new system may help pave the way to a plethora of brazilian and argentine funds aimed at the british small investor
FT941-10900	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 26 venturing in search of higher yields bond markets	fixed income investors are proving ever more adventurous in their quest for higher yields turning to the world s more exotic emerging market locations to invest their funds while the yields on us treasury bonds japanese government debt and european government bonds have declined steadily over the past couple of years bond issues from some of the emerging economies have provided fixed income investors with an attractive high yielding alternative many international investors are already familiar and comfortable with the idea of investing in emerging market debt which is denominated in us dollars yen or one of the core european currencies but recently the trend has been for the more adventurous investors to explore the domestic debt route investing in government and where possible corporate bond markets lots of people are out looking for opportunities and an increasing number of emerging market debt funds are looking at these domestic debt markets says ms elizabeth morrissey managing partner of kleiman international consultants which specialises in emerging markets and which publishes data on the emerging bond and money markets while emerging market debt funds already invest in brady bonds and eurobonds some are turning to the domestic bond markets of emerging economies as well of the various domestic debt markets mexico has already seen considerable interest in 1992 and 1993 international investors eagerly invested in mexican cetes or short dated paper to obtain double digit yields north africa is attracting a lot of international investor interest at the moment in countries such as morocco and egypt you can obtain double digit yields tax free and it s really not that difficult to buy the paper says ms morrissey in ghana short and medium dated paper yields over 30 per cent she adds given that the yields on us treasury bonds reached their lowest levels in nearly 20 years last year it is easy to see why double digit yields are such a lure other markets which are attracting investor interest include the peruvian corporate bond market where the paper is denominated in us dollars ms morrissey says this is seen as an evolving market given that there have been several new issues although she maintains it is still easier to invest in peru via the eurobond market the problem with some of these emerging bond markets is the currency risk as an investor you have to feel confident with the government s overall economic policy and interest rate policy says ms morrissey mr justin cormack an emerging markets fund manager at guinness flight points out that many of these domestic bond markets are quite large but can be difficult to invest in for example south korea guinness flight recently launched an asian currency and bond fund which has attracted about dollars 11m from investors so far and which invests in the domestic bond markets of malaysia thailand indonesia south korea hong kong and india which is seen as particularly attractive because of the high yields available as well as more developed markets in the region such as australia and new zealand mr cormack believes there are several good reasons to invest in the region s bond markets many of these countries will need to borrow heavily for substantial infrastructure projects at the same time some of the domestic stock markets are relatively expensive while the currencies are cheap and have scope to appreciate mr cormack says for some international investors these domestic bond markets may still seem rather esoteric their route into the emerging markets tends to be through the international bond market where there has been a plentiful supply of new issues particularly from the latin american countries last year was a bumper year in the eurobond market with record new issuance of dollars 412bn up from dollars 279bn in 1992 according to figures compiled by ifr securities data of the dollars 412bn in new issuance dollars 35 9bn equivalent to 8 7 per cent of the total was issued by emerging market names with the bulk of this dollars 29 7bn issued in dollars the volume of new issues from emerging market borrowers especially latin american ones has surged total new issues from the emerging markets has more than doubled from a total of dollars 14 4bn in 1992 to dollars 35 9bn last year and total issuance from latin american names has increased from dollars 9 88bn 106 issues in 1992 to dollars 19 2bn 187 issues in 1993 according to ifr securities data mexico brazil and argentina remain the most important source of new issues and as investors have become more familiar with the individual corporate names the yield spreads in other words the yield pick up over the relevant us treasury bond for new issues have gradually narrowed while yields in the secondary market have continued to decline at the same time there have been several exciting new developments in the latin american sector in the past year partly aimed at enhancing their appeal to investors these include the launch of larger more liquid issues the issuance of bonds in a wider range of currencies and a noticeable trend towards longer maturities five and 10 year bond issues have become a more common occurrence and pemex the mexican state oil company issued a dollars 250m 30 year yankee bond with a coupon of 8 5 8 per cent last year cemex the largest cement company in mexico set the trend for larger issues with the launch of a dollars 1bn five year eurobond issue in may 1993 this was the biggest eurobond issue ever by an emerging market name since then the republic of argentina has raised dollars 1bn with a global bond issue and at the start of 1994 bancomext mexico s state owned import and export bank launched the first global dollars 1bn 10 year deal for a mexican borrower larger bond issues are obviously more liquid in the secondary market a factor which is appreciated by international investors who tend to complain about the poor liquidity of dollars 100 200m issues emerging market specialists point out that there is much more investor interest in these large liquid issues in addition the more frequent latin american borrowers in the international bond market have become more adventurous currency wise braving the non dollar currency sectors for example the republic of venezuela has issued d mark eurobonds while pemex has issued canadian dollar sterling and french franc eurobonds mr ian tweedley director at west merchant bank points out that by issuing in other currencies latin american borrowers have been able to reach a wider range of investors and this process of diversification seems likely to

FT941-10901	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 27 analysts point to pricing anomalies brady bonds	from unsure beginnings brady bonds have become one of the most actively traded sectors of the international bond markets the bonds emerged from the ashes of the 1980s developing country debt crisis and the debt initiative launched in 1989 by the then us treasury secretary nicholas brady brady bonds were concessional bonds issued to holders of bank debt which had been subject to restructurings throughout the 1980s often the bonds were backed by guarantees of some interest and principal now the universe of brady bonds is around dollars 95bn of which issues amounting to something less than dollars 80bn are actively traded a large proportion of these bonds are no longer held by banks and are traded among individual and increasingly institutional investors for much of the 1990s helped by the improved economic performance of countries such as mexico and argentina the prices of brady bonds have moved relentlessly upwards as yields fell on the bonds of these well performing governments investors began to cast the net wider seeking high yields even poorly performing countries such as nigeria and countries without a brady deal such as peru have seen the prices of their debt rising sharply the rises j p morgan calculates total 1993 return from fixed rate brady bonds last year were 48 99 per cent and floating rate brady bonds 38 37 per cent have been such that some investors have begun to question whether there is anything left for investors in the brady bond market to argue that there is many analysts are pointing to what they say are pricing anomalies between the brady bond market and comparable eurobonds typical of these anomalies is the yield gap between the dollars 1bn global bond issued by mexico s bancomext in january and so called aztec bonds issued by the government under a 1988 attempt to restructure debt which anticipated the brady initiative the issue for state owned bancomext was launched at around 160 basis points of 10 year us treasury note rates the aztec bonds which mature in 14 years time yield 200 basis points over the treasury yield curve yet because of the us treasury collateral the yield stripped of its us treasury element is calculated at 400 basis points or more significantly more than the bancomext issue mr shahriar shahida head of emerging market debt trading and sales at paribas capital markets in london argues that not only do many brady bond issues yield more than equivalent eurobonds but they are also often more liquid and easy to trade mr paul luke at morgan grenfell and others say that brady bonds may be a superior risk to comparable eurobonds he argues that in latin american restructurings arising from defaults in the 1930s bondholders that had already been forced to take a write down were treated better in subsequent restructurings furthermore the specialness of the latin eurobond issues which meant that there were no significant defaults through the 1980s because there were hardly any outstanding bonds is disappearing some dollars 25bn of new bond market debt was issued by latin american issuers last year alone some investors still believe that the biggest gains are to be made in that shrinking number of countries yet to achieve a brady deal brazil which has scheduled a closing for its brady deal by april 15 peru ecuador and poland have all to complete brady reschedulings the price of peru s debt for example has risen sevenfold in the past couple of years and is now trading at 70 cents to the dollar roughly half of this is accounted for by unpaid interest some investors are still excited by the opportunity for profit through an expected active debt for equity swap programme in the mould of argentina s privatisation plan investors in this pre brady debt have emerged as an increasingly important force the dart family of the us which made its fortune in the 1960s through the invention of the polystyrene cup has amassed a holding of at least dollars 1 2bn face value of brazilian debt 3 5 per cent of the outstanding medium term debt not held by brazilian banks the family is unwilling to join the agreement carved out between the banks and the government which threatens to hold up the agreement the darts bankers reckon may have important positions in other pre brady countries
FT941-10902	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 25 continent of hazard and opportunity africa	which of the world s emerging markets can boast an investment fund where a dollars 1 000 stake a year ago has risen to nearly dollars 1 500 surprisingly the answer is africa even more surprising the country concerned is nigeria where the economic reform programme has collapsed but a shrewd purchase of nigerian debt is paying off for investors the new york based international asset transactions decided in 1992 that nigerian promissory notes issued in the mid 1980s to clear dollars 4 2bn in trade arrears and par bonds which discounted commercial bank debt at 40 cents to the dollar in a 1991 settlement with the london club were underpriced gus udo and donna young of iat noted that servicing these deals cost nigeria comparatively little around 14 days a year of the country s 1 4m barrel daily production of oil they reckoned that no sensible government would alienate the banks and the trading houses by defaulting on the terms of the two settlements so in january 1993 they launched the nigeria emerging market fund an open end mutual fund registered in the cayman islands with about two thirds in nigeria central bank promissory notes and most of the balance in brady par bonds the results have been remarkable behind the general view that africa s debt instruments are generally undervalued lies a fundamental reappraisal of the continent s prospects africa is poised for growth declares morgan stanley which has launched a dollars 40m africa investment fund its bullish 50 page appraisal of the continent argues that the economic and political reforms under way for the best part of a decade are coming good prices for the region s exports such as cocoa coffee gold are recovering and industrial metals are bottoming africa argues the report which includes a useful guide to the dozen stock markets operating and the 20 others being developed harbours undervalued assets particularly in the natural resource and manufacturing sectors where stock markets are up and running says morgan stanley investors can find attractively priced issues both on a price earnings and price to book basis by international standards the african market excluding south africa which ranks just outside the world s top 10 is tiny its exchanges have a combined market capitalisation of around dollars 12bn compared to india s dollars 91bn nevertheless the belief in the resurgence of africa s fortunes led by hopes for a thriving post apartheid south africa has caught the imagination of international fund managers mr miles morland of london based blakeney management calculates that at least dollars 3bn of foreign money is being targeted at south africa and a further dollars 1bn at the rest of africa in 1994 peanuts in mexico or hong kong but they are liable to blow the african market apart at the seams the total amount of stock available in the whole of africa excluding south africa is about dollars 2 2bn he reckons if almost half of this turns over in 1994 a huge increase on the 1993 levels there will still only be dollars 1bn of african equities to be fought over by local investors global investors and all the new africa funds the continent s heavyweight is south africa with a market capitalisation of some dollars 150bn south africa is not so much an emerging market but a re emerging market comments nigel scheckter of micropal the boston based fund performance measurement service which monitors 26 000 funds but the true float is tiny relative to the wave

buying in the second half of 1993 helped more than double the industrial index morocco and tunisia is the excitement warranted are the risks appreciated and how well do the analysts know africa morgan stanley s upbeat view of the continent does not overlook the problems pointing among other things to weak management and what it calls africa s fear and distrust of foreign business influence but the overall picture that emerges may strike some readers as too rosy the assertion that tribal tension in most of black africa is probably less of a problem than racial tension in the us may simply be an unorthodox view more serious is the assertion that 28 of africa s 50 states have economic reform programmes in place this list is based says morgan stanley on world bank evaluations not always it should be said the best judge of its own reform efforts some examples of reform listed by morgan stanley are risible such as zaire where the political and economic malaise deepens by the day also on the list is burundi where the recent coup which took place after the report s publication illustrates the volatility of the african condition the inclusion of sao tome little more than a dot in the ocean trivialises the list nigeria a powerhouse waiting to happen according to morgan stanley perseveres with its structural adjustment programme launched in 1986 writes the analyst at the time the report was published october 1993 it was clear that nigeria s erratic attempt to implement the programme was the reason an imf agreement lapsed some two years ago any hopes that nigeria s military regime would revive the lapsed programme were set back last month when it fixed the exchange rate and local interest rates at unrealistic levels africa s performance in general has been weak as professor tony hawkins of the university of zimbabwe writes in a recent paper more than a dozen years after the launch of aid funded structural adjustment programmes it is impossible to identify a single mainland sub saharan country that has made a success of economic reform the best that can be said he continues is that in countries such as ghana and uganda the spiral of decline has been reversed but it will take well into the next century before earlier living standards are regained a somewhat tougher investment appraisal comes from the meridien biao group which runs a network of banks in 20 countries across africa led by andrew sardanis and colin goodwin two veteran africa hands the investment climate is improving says colin goodwin president of the group but by nothing like enough investment through individual african stock exchanges is not the best route for the emerging market fund he adds as these exchanges are still too small and surrounded by too many restrictions the response of africans with resources abroad may well prove the acid test of whether an african investment makes sense if the continent s politicians businessmen civil servants are not risking their

FT941-10903	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 24 magic carpet not ready for take off middle east	equity markets in the arab world are not yet in a position to offer a soaring magic carpet to international investors the swathe of states from morocco to syria have no roaring economic tigers and there is as yet no golden prospect of a capitalist rebirth though progress towards middle east peace has quickened the pulse of many investors most countries remain in the very earliest stages of liberalising reforms which might eventually present profitable opportunities but the region is far from being an equity desert most states have stock markets of varying maturities and development the exceptions being libya syria yemen and for the time being lebanon and although most markets are either closed to foreign investors or difficult to penetrate international interest is rising a survey by kleiman international consultants last november found that half of the 40 institutions it surveyed had holdings in middle eastern or north african markets in 1993 against just 7 per cent in 1990 the trick according to the growing number of institutions showing an interest in the region s generally pre emerging markets is careful picking and choosing and while none of the region s markets makes it for instance into the economist s new premiership league table of 24 markets to watch investors have already begun to pick some regional leaders and laggards two markets in particular are already being singled out for particular attention chief among these is jordan s market the amman financial market with more than 110 listed companies and capitalisation of jd3 5bn is among the region s most profitable and ably run buoyed by two successive years of strong real economic growth sustained government commitment to international monetary fund reforms high liquidity and most recently by optimism over the peace process the market s index rose by 30 per cent in 1992 and was a further 23 per cent up by the end of last year although the government and its agencies hold substantial stakes in many jordanian companies notably in tourism and minerals companies it is nevertheless among the most highly traded markets in the region mr miles morland of blakeney consultants one of the few middle east market specialists says at least half of total issued stock is tradeable far higher than the regional average as important in mr morland s view is the degree of local participation in the market in which he estimates there are around 100 000 participants few if any middle eastern bourses can compare on that count such buoyancy has attracted considerable outside interest even though direct non arab participation in the market requires government approval a procedure which can take months official figures suggest however that at least 15 per cent of the market is in non jordanian mostly gulf arab hands only 2 3 per cent is reckoned to be held by non arabs but this should change given the degree of interest being shown by western institutions ten leading institutions including lehman brothers goldman sachs baring securities and citicorp recently won approval from the prime minister s office to operate in the market and according to mr dan smaller of lehmans the market can expect substantial inward investment during 1994 the peace process has taken away a big risk even if the details of peace take time to negotiate the breakthrough has removed a big obstacle he says adding that he expects lehman to commit up to dollars 25m to the market during the first quarter of this year the second regional star performer is morocco where investors are impressed less by the maturity of the local stock market than by the government s clear and so far successful commitment to privatisation the casablanca bourse remains lethargic suffering the common regional ailments of a shortage of scrip only 69 companies are listed and low liquidity but this has not impeded a large influx of foreign capital into a privatisation programme which the government has been seeing through with untypical energy for the region as mr morland remarks privatisation is the key because that s what forces governments to look at their stock markets last year the moroccan government exceeded by 40 per cent its target of state asset sales with total receipts hitting dollars 250m by the end of 1995 the government aims to have sold a further 112 companies or assets worth almost dollars 2bn and foreign buyers are being embraced at the end of last year for example a french subsidiary of holderbank bought a 51 per cent stake in cior the state cement group in an offering which was five times oversubscribed the sale last summer of ctm a state transport group also injected 40 per cent of its capital into the equity market and analysts are confident that privatisation will substantially add to the supply of new scrip throughout 1994 elsewhere in the region however prospects appear more mixed in north africa tunisia is seen as offering some opportunities again because of the government s commitment to imf guided liberalisation policies and its equal desire to attract foreign capital however tunisia s privatisation programme continues to move more cautiously than in morocco where some analysts also consider that the absence of any history of socialist administration is also giving casablanca an enterprising edge egypt is perhaps the greatest disappointment in the region although the government has made remarkable progress with broad macro economic reforms under two years of imf tutelage its own privatisation programme has become heavily bogged down by a combination of bureaucratic inertia and profound government caution over the potential political effects of selling off large parts of the sprawling public sector the result has been to deprive egypt s market of the new issues it requires to establish a properly liquid bourse one which before the 1950s was the world s fifth busiest although more than 450 companies are technically listed on the exchange no more than 35 or so are ever traded and kidder peabody includes only 24 of these on its market index as truly liquid stocks these according to mr aladdin saba vice president of kidder peabody egypt represent a capitalisation of around epounds 1bn usdollars 297m direct foreign participation is possible though some companies retain a statutory ban on foreign ownership and according to mr saba some foreign money has been entering the market over the past 18 months mainly from the gulf the result has been to lift the kidder index by more than 60 per cent over the past year but as mr saba concedes this was from a low base there is also some disappointment in the market over the new capital market regulations introduced last year which abolished an historical imbalance in the taxation of dividends and bank deposits many consider the new rules which also govern the creation of market intermediaries remain too restrictive the government looked at these rules as a regulatory instrument rather than as a business opportunity says one market player who believes egypt is in danger of losing out to jordan and other regional bourses for the time being this excludes markets in the gulf states which remain closed to foreign investment but this too may soon change the biggest and healthiest gulf market in saudi arabia boasts a capitalisation of around dollars 50bn and vigorous trading so far however the saudi authorities have resisted any temptation to open their floorless and increasingly sophisticated market to foreign investors other gulf states however may prove less cautious oman and bahrain in particular are already examining ways to open their small bourses for mr morland and several other analysts these markets may well be among the most interesting of 1994 falling oil prices diminishing state revenues and the attendant appeal of attracting foreign capital into non oil industrial ventures might all spur a greater opening mr morland suggests my guess is this is the year when these markets will begin to emerge he says just this month the government of the united arab emirates set up a cabinet committee to examine formalising and centralising its kerb share market the committee is expected to consider from the outset the option of opening the market to international investors another newcomer over the next year could be syria where a draft bill for the country s first stock exchange has been awaiting submission to the people s assembly since last spring informal share trading thrives in the damascus souk and many businessmen in the country believe an official market is an inevitable concomitant to syria s cautious economic liberalisation though little financial infrastructure exists at present in what remains a highly centralised state based economy but perhaps the most exciting prospect in the region lies in lebanon where the stock market has been closed since it was abandoned at the height of the civil war in 1983 the successful offering to lebanese and arab investors in solidere the company established to rebuild downtown beirut has created the basis upon which the lebanese government will restart what many in the region consider likely to be the middle east s most promising market andersen consultants in london are already working on creating the framework for a secondary market in the dollars 1 8bn company s shares and the central bank says it hopes to see trading in up to eight companies shares within eight months few doubt the appeal of a resumed lebanese stock market which is likely to be open to outside capital those with the greatest faith in the inherent trading ability of the lebanese predict the new market will be among the highest flyers in 1994 95

outperform all the world s emerging markets according to the world bank s international finance corporation thanks to robust retail demand an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and timely legal changes giving tax breaks for those funds investing in equities the 85 share index has been pushed to record heights the market lists some 150 companies and is capitalised at around usdollars 30bn daily trading volume is around dollars 80m the best performers are those companies with low debt and a strong franchise in the local market such as arcelik the white goods manufacturer local retailer migros or beer companies such as ege biracilik brokers say there has been a marked deepening in the market with the arrival of foreign investors and more tentatively the local institutional buyers but trading still suffers from a shortage of liquidity a restrictive settlement system and the lack of good research facilities for the bull market to continue the government will have to contain its own appetite for funds which has had a damaging effect not only crowding out the equity markets but undermining corporate profitability as borrowing costs have been pushed higher today treasury bills and other official debt instruments still account for 80 per cent of capital market activity there also remains some concern about the permanence of the government s interest rate policy after the central bank last month was forced to devalue the lira by 12 per cent after raising interbank rates which at one time reached 200 per cent if interest rates are to settle at these new levels equities may find it harder to entice funds away from fixed interest instruments this could force the small retail investor who has provided much of the momentum of the bull market to reconsider his portfolio options for all that there remains an underlying confidence in the market brokers point out that in dollar terms the index still has some way to go to attain the levels enjoyed in the 1990 bull market which lasted until the day saddam hussein s tanks rolled into kuwait the market has made considerable strides on the regulatory side and in improving settlement and clearance systems under the turkish practice on any transaction the physical delivery of stock must be completed before the end of the following day this is a direct result of turkey s high inflation it is also an attempt to encourage trading in larger volumes and take away some of the attractions of speculative dealing but for foreign investors particularly those dealing from far flung markets such as hong kong where there is a time difference it can present a serious headache in an effort to ease this problem the exchange has now introduced a new centralised custodian system which accounts for 70 per cent of transactions in addition a new electronic trading system was inaugurated in early december on some 50 shares the whole exchange shifts to screen based system later this year when trading moves to its new premises the market s other constraints have more to do with turkey s particularly conservative corporate culture where equity finance remains a small part in the thinking of many companies private concerns are wary of the disclosure requirements and the dilution of ownership however all that may soon change reforms have been introduced to allow companies to float non voting shares in addition the new tax law included incentives for companies going public brokers anticipate a wave of new issues as companies seek to rationalise the spread of their empires ahead of the move to a customs union in 1995 equity finance could also be useful as companies upgrade technologies in a bid to keep pace with the renewed competition from imports the number of public offerings has already increased as banks seek to float subsidiaries in a bid to meet new capital requirements set by the basle based bank of international settlements a less welcome prospect is that the market might be flooded with government stock as turkey s privatisation speeds up if only for political reasons turkey seems destined to offer some part of the state corporations now being considered for privatisation to local investors how well the market digests this will depend largely on whether big turkish institutions are attracted the fund managers of insurance companies and state enterprises have traditionally remained averse to risk preferring government securities to dabbling in the more uncertain waters of the equity market however rule changes introduced in 1993 now make it easier for banks and brokerages to establish funds the law also provides tax breaks for those a type funds invested in equities according to figures from the capital market board the government s securities watchdog the government has approved 23 funds with a further 13 under consideration it is still a relatively immature area many banks for example make use of funds they establish to buy stock in their own industrial affiliates as one leading broker put it that s not fund management that s price fixing but on one thing the brokerage community is agreed this is the only way forward for only with the ballast provided by long term institutional investors will turkey s market attract fresh interest and enable the index to reach new heights
FT941-10905	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 21 creating capitalism without capital eastern europe	nowhere is the term emerging market more apposite than in central europe where markets of all kinds have emerged over the past two or three years from what president lech walesa of poland once called the fish soup of a command economy a system with no place for markets or real money or economic logic the speed with which commodity and financial markets alike have gained in size scope and efficiency has been phenomenal certainly as dramatic as the equally under appreciated structural changes in the economies of the region leading the pack have been the fast track reforming economies of central europe the czech republic hungary poland and to a lesser extent slovakia with the addition of slovenia and estonia the first of the former soviet states to establish a viable currency whole swathes of the economies of the fast track reformers including politically sensitive heavy industries such as steel making and mining have been scaled back leading to heavy unemployment which the fast growing private sector emerging from local entrepreneurship and foreign investment has been able only partially to prevent turning politically dangerous as a general rule markets have developed pari passu with privatisation although in the specific case of financial markets with a certain delay due to the time needed to train staff in the hitherto arcane arts of buying selling and valuing securities and for putting in place the necessary physical equipment from security printing of share certificates to stock exchange screens but 1993 saw emerging financial markets come into their own first warsaw then prague and then with greater caution budapest experienced extraordinary stock market booms as a wall of local and foreign investment hit fledgling markets with their tiny lists of quoted stocks the boom on the warsaw stock exchange wse the star performer on world stock markets last year was sparked off by a sharp fall in the interest paid on local bank deposits in the first half of the year as poles cautiously at first and then with abandon piled into

polish trust fund and invested heavily in the fast rising market lift off began just after easter and brought warsaw s wig index racing up from a 1993 low of 1 040 at the start of the year to 11 760 at the end of 1993 convinced of the unsustainability of such a meteoric rise which pushed p e ratios into the high 30s in many cases many foreign investors quietly took profits over the latter part of the year and waited for what could be a substantial market correction such is the weight of local money however that shares have continued to find local buyers so the year started on a high note although a sure proof of two way trading was the way that trading was characterised by high volume rather than higher prices significantly poland s new left of centre government has decided that a healthy stock market is too important to jeopardise by imposing punitive taxation or too many restrictions strapped for cash and obliged by the imf to keep the deficit around 4 5 per cent of gdp the

investors are looking for a steady flow of reasonably priced initial public offers ipos to sustain their interest in the market while warsaw was last year s star performer however prague looks poised to take over the mantle this year the success of the first round of mass privatisation has put most of the shares of the 1 300 companies into the hands of a dozen investment funds the shares were offered at way below book value to the 8m citizens who took up the government s offer of privatisation vouchers costing dollars 30 more than 70 per cent of voucher holders deposited them with the

controlled by pepsi cola with a further 800 companies at present being privatised in the second round of the mass privatisation scheme mpp and fund managers anxious to raise liquidity by issuing new equity the prague bourse seems set for a phase of rapid expansion in the years to come somewhat ironically budapest whose budding financial entrepreneurs were the first to set up a stock exchange has been the least expansive stock market to date early investors suffered substantial paper losses on the initially over priced first issues and several shares remain below 1992 levels in real terms in spite of the 50 per cent rise in the market over the last weeks of the year the relatively slow development of the budapest bourse is largely conditioned by the fact that much privatisation has been through trade sales to foreign investors rather than mass privatisation schemes or stock market flotations but with elections looming in may hungary too is heading for a limited form of mpp as the realisation dawned on politicians that schemes which gave ordinary citizens a material stake in former state industries were politically popular whatever the original motivation however the development of stock exchanges and other financial institutions such as pension funds insurance companies and revamped self financing health insurance funds is providing an answer to the basic question which hovered over post communist europe only four years ago how to create capitalism without capital the answer seems to be through a combination of foreign investment and the mechanisms and markets needed to tap the domestic savings generated by rising income differentials and structural reforms which eliminate the wasteful and irrational old ways

FT941-10908	ft 07 feb 94 survey of emerging markets 20 edging closer to us standards mexico	mexico s financial convergence with the us is forcing its stock market to adopt us practices of accounting disclosure and financial analysis the result is the most sophisticated and liquid emerging market in latin america but one which can still spring surprises for ill prepared investors the financial integration which is expected to intensify with implementation of the north american free trade agreement is having a profound impact on the way mexican companies manage their businesses companies that used to be controlled by one or two families and could afford to ignore outside shareholders are now keeping in touch with domestic and international investors and are highly sensitive to their criticisms however the harmonisation is far from complete and the mexican bolsa is much more volatile than that of a typically mature market as was demonstrated at the time of the new year uprising in the state of chiapas daily movements of 5 per cent are not uncommon for many companies liaison with investors is already as close as that of the us there is a huge dichotomy between the highly sophisticated mexican companies quoted on the new york stock exchange and what is happening in the economy as a whole where average incomes are only dollars 4 000 per capita says mr timothy heyman of baring securities in mexico city the main pressure for change has come from mexican companies that have raised capital internationally and have sought listings in the us to attract foreign money these companies have had to adopt us rules of disclosure and to accept us focus on short term earnings performance american depositary receipts adrs of practically every large mexican company are now traded in new york while a growing number of mexican companies enjoy full listing on the new york stock exchange including telmex vitro televisa dina ica radio centro while some companies have managed the

cementos mexicanos the cement company for not warning investors it intended to use money from an equity offering to buy two spanish cement companies sanson and valenciana cemex says at the time of the offering it was not planning to buy the companies telmex the largest quoted company in mexico is one of the few us quoted companies without a professional firm of public relations and occasionally its management s inexperience has created difficulties with international investors at a conference in new york last june the company finance director caused the telmex stock price to tumble after making what he thought were innocuous remarks about low earnings prospects investors also complain that information about a company often reaches some participants before others mexico s stock market watchdog tightened rules on insider trading last year it says that it is investigating several cases of participants using privileged information for gain mexico has the problem of every emerging market there exists the ability to acquire information ahead of public announcements says jeremy campbell lamerton managing director of the london branch of inverlat a mexican broker most fund managers in mexico are also stockbrokers and investors have complained that they shuffle money between mutual funds they run and the stockbrokers own accounts to the disadvantage of some clients when you are the operator distributor evaluator and seller of the fund there is a conflict of interest says mr carlos de laborde general director of covap mexico s largest mutual fund reviewer the government last december passed new regulations that make it more difficult for fund mangers to buy and sell shares for a mutual fund at less or more than the true market value covap which is an independent body now evaluates about 140 of the 230 mutual funds in mexico mexico is slowly moving to us accounting standards says jorge mariscal of goldman sachs the latest example is the decision of banks to adopt us rules of evaluating goodwill mr mariscal expects eventually there will be few important accounting differences between the two countries while mexican accounting can confuse americans by expressing numbers in constant terms ie eliminating the effect of inflation this is becoming less important as mexican inflation falls to us levels eventually mexico is expected to abandon inflation accounting for mexico the cost of harmonisation with the us is that it is losing control of its own capital markets because dealing costs are lower in the us than in mexico and liquidity of trading often higher in the us than in mexico many foreign investors prefer to buy stocks in new york the research on mexican companies by foreign brokerages is considered better than
